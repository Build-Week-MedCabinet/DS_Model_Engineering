THC levels are said to be fierce, surpassing 19% in some tests, while CBD levels are considerably lower, less than 1%.

Instead, this strain is a useful means of treating depression, glaucoma and eye pressure, headaches, muscle spasms, and nausea. The full, heavy body high is calming and sleepy, so Paris OG is also good for insomnia, and it induces euphoria, happiness, and a tingly sensation.

38,THC Bomb,"Don't let the name fool you: THC levels are definitely strong in this strain, higher than 20% in some cases, but THC Bomb doesn't exactly deliver an explosion. In reality, it's a useful but not exceedingly potent medical choice, name notwithstanding. Use this strain to treat anxiety, stress, chronic pain, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and sleeplessness. The indica-dominant effects (sativa/indica ratio unclear) are perfect for late nights or rainy days – calming and sleepy but also happy and hungry. That makes THC Bomb an effective strain for alleviating clinical lack of appetite. It isn't such a good choice for patients who need CBD to treat seizures or other conditions, as this strain definitely isn't known for its CBD levels. They're not widely reported, and that alone recommends against this strain as a source of this chemical. THC Bomb has an earthy, Skunky taste and smell, with an additional sour flavor. The nugs are loose and green with orange hairs. The most likely side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, red eyes, headaches, and paranoia. THC Bomb can be found in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and Colorado.

51,Cannatonic,"This strain is an even blend of sativa and indica (50:50 sativa/indica ratio). It's a great medical strain high in CBD, a chemical used to treat severe seizures and other conditions. But it's very low in THC 7–15% at most – so Cannatonic isn't a good bet for getting high, despite its name. The high, such as it is, is relaxed and uplifting with both mental and physical qualities. Cannatonic has an earthy smell, with a woody citrus flavor. It's most popular in the Pacific Northwest, California, and Michigan. This strain is best for treating epilepsy and pain, as it provides a deep feeling of relaxation with uplifting cerebral effects. Cannatonic is a hybrid blend of MK Ultra, an indica, and the legendary G-13 Haze, an indica-dominant hybrid. The strain was bred to produce a greater ratio of sativa to indica, and that helps keep the head high clear.

Tutankhamen has a sweet fruity taste of citrus and earth with a slightly skunky aftertaste that becomes pungent upon exhale. The aroma is surprisingly delicate, with a rich floral earthy smell that has only a hint of sweetness to it. Tutankhamen buds have large oversized Christmas-tree shaped forest green nugs with dark olive green leaves, thick purple hairs, and a super sticky layer of visible sweet resin. The Tutankhamen high is characterized by a stoney introspective cerebral state. You’ll be hit with an immediate onset of a cerebral head rush that numbs the mind and leaves you hazy and distant. A numbing body high will slowly overtake you, leaving you completely relaxed and helplessly couch-locked with a deep sense of spacey introspection.

This is typically long and elongated in appearance, with somewhat puffed buds on the taller plants, and has light green, dark green, and specks of gold woven throughout. It is a 80/20 indica dominant hybrid. Chronic originated by a cross between Northern Light X, Skunk X, and AK47 marijuana strains. It is particularly useful medically for aiding in pain relief, relieving the symptoms of depression, anxiety, loss of appetite, and other similar types of conditions.

It's a Washington original, grown by at least two local cultivators, Olympia Mike and A Green Cure. It's a blend of Lemon Skunk and Super Silver Haze, and it has a sativa/indica ratio of 80:20. That means heady, peppy, cerebral effects: arousal, creativity, energy, euphoria, and intense happiness. These make for ideal tools in treating depression, fatigue, anxiety, nausea, and chronic pain. THC levels soar in this strain, with at least one sample topping 25%, and that puts Super Lemon Haze near the top of the potency pyramid. But it isn't known for its CBD levels, which regularly test well below 1%. In other words, this strain shouldn't be used as the only medicine for conditions that respond to CBD, such as seizure disorders. Super Lemon Haze has a tart, zesty lemon flavor and aroma, with sweet notes of candy. The bud, which has a speckled green-and-brown appearance, is covered with a dense layer of resinous trichomes.

Some smokers report an overwhelming sensation of cerebral energy thus this strain is not recommended for people suffering from sleeplessness.

It's most useful in treating chronic pain, including migraines and arthritis, though it also helps relieve anxiety, depression, and PTSD. The high is profoundly relaxing, a full-body experience that can lead to strong couch-lock and deep sleep. This is definitely a nighttime strain, as it can have a near-comatose effect. But the high can also be euphoric and focused, with a clear mind. Dry mouth is common, as are red eyes. Most easily found on the West Coast, in Colorado, and in Michigan, this popular strain can also be purchased across the country, on both legal and black markets.

152,Purple OG Kush,"This popular, potent medical choice is an indica-dominant cross of Purple Kush and Cali OG Kush, both widely loved strains. The exact balance of sativa to indica in this strain isn't widely known, but it leans heavily in favor of the indica genes.

CBD numbers, meanwhile, are well below 1%, marking this strain as a poor choice for treating seizures or other maladies that respond to that substance. But Purple OG Kush can be used effectively as treatment for chronic pain, lack of appetite, insomnia, depression, and stress. The high, mostly physical, is deeply relaxing, spacey, and sleepy, with a pleasing body buzz. A sweet aroma of berries and musk pairs well with the fruity, Kush-like flavor of this strain.

155,Medicine Man,"Medicine Man is an indica dominant strain with an 80:20 indica/sativa ratio. The strain has grown immensely popular because of its THC content which exceeds 23%. Keeping this in mind, the faint of heart are advised to stay away from the strain as it is strong and has an incredible punch to go along with it.

The buds are quite dense with solid red and yellow hairs. The strain is known for its strong sedating effects, it will overpower you as soon as you smoke it. This is one of the reasons why it is not recommended to new cannabis users. Medicine Man will make you feel more focused but then again its body numb can make you feel lazy.

Black Widow is only recommended for patients who have been toking for a while, as its intensity can overwhelm novice users and potentially trigger panic attacks. But for those who can tolerate the venom, this strain is good for depression, physical pain, muscle spasms, headaches, and everyday stress. It's also perfect for inducing hunger in patients with wasting or eating disorders. Black Widow, surprisingly enough, isn't a descendant of the more famous White Widow; rather, they're siblings or cousins, descending from the same unknown Brazilian sativa and an indica from South India. Anticipate dry mouth and bloodshot eyes, while dizziness, headaches, and paranoia are less likely side effects. Black Widow sells well almost everywhere, but it's most popular on the legal markets in California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington State, and Michigan.",Sativa,,,24.0,Sweet Chemical Fruity Skunky Woody Nutty,Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy

With THC levels reaching 20%, this is a potent strain with strong medical effects. It's best for treating sleep disorders, migraines, minor body pains, and chronic stress. It's also effective at treating nausea and lack of appetite. CBD levels are much lower, about 0.5%, so this strain isn't recommended for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD. Cherry Kush is a descendant of OG Kush and a Purple Afghani, both indicas. It's used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and nausea, as well as lack of appetite and chronic pain. The Cherry Kush high is body-focused, with strong couch-lock and deep relaxation. It's strongly euphoric and induces sleep. Side effects include dry mouth, dry eyes, and strong hunger. The buds are bright green and frosted with a dense layer of trichomes. This strain has a sweet, pungent flavor with hints of berry.

174,Bruce Banner,"This homage to the comic book legend could turn even the Incredible Hulk into a mild-mannered everyman. It's powerfully relaxing, with sativa-dominant genes (60:40 sativa/indica ratio) that deliver a massive dose of THC: Nearly 29% in some tests. That makes this a holy grail of sorts for patients seeking the strongest high. CBD contents, however, are low, so this is not an ideal choice for conditions that respond to that chemical. The head high is intensely euphoric, combined with strong creativity and a whole-body mood boost. Energy levels are high, making this a good daytime strain. Bruce Banner is a highly effective painkiller, but it's also good for anxiety, depression, nausea, and sleeplessness. Dry mouth and bloodshot eyes are both common side effects, along with occasional paranoia and dizziness. The dominant flavor is sweet, with notes of citrus and a strong, pungent smell. The bud has a heavily frosted appearance due to a thick layer of resinous glands. It's most popular in Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon, though it can be found elsewhere.

This particular strain is attributed as effective in treating a host of chronic conditions like stress, insomnia, anxiety, depression and pain.

The strain has a serious kick to it and its psychoactive effects are evidently detectable in both body and mind. It manages to deliver an overwhelming feeling of physical relaxation and cerebral euphoria.

There is a pretty good reason why it is known as Blackberry Kush, it does have a berry taste to it after all. What is really amazing about Blackberry Kush is that you will require very little of it to get the high you want. However, smoking too much of the strain will make you sleep in no time. This explains why it is highly preferred by patients suffering from pain and insomnia. However, since it is an indica dominant strain, it is better for night time use.

These buds have long tapered pepper-shaped forest green nugs with deep rich purple undertones, fiery orange hairs, and a thinly spread layer of fine clear crystal trichomes. This high is characterized by full-bodied indica effects that slowly creep on before hitting you like too many drinks.

It's best used to treat anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, but it's also good for insomnia and headaches, as well as some mental disorders. This strain can be especially powerful, with THC levels as high as 24%. It has a distinct earthy flavor and aroma, with a taste of chestnut and tealeaves. As with most strains, the most likely adverse effects are dry eyes and dry mouth. Paranoia and dizziness are also possible but less common.

222,Orange Kush,"The sativa genes of OG Kush and the indica genes of Orange Bud were blended to form Orange Kush, allegedly an indica-dominant hybrid (reports on the sativa/indica ratio of this strain are unreliable at best). The flavor is tangy and citrusy while the smell has strong, sweet notes of orange. The buds have lime-green leaves and bright orange hairs to match the name. THC levels are known to top 22%, making this one of the strongest strains on any market, legal or otherwise. CBD, on the other hand, is very scarce, less than half of 1 percent, much too low to suggest Orange Kush as good treatment for seizure disorders and other problems that can be alleviated with CBD. The effects of this strain certainly hint at its indica leanings: powerful euphoria, deep physical relaxation, happiness, sleepiness, and a potent case of the munchies. That alone makes this a great tool in treating eating or wasting disorders, but Orange Kush is also a good choice for patients who suffer from anxiety, depression, ADHD, inflammation, migraine headaches, muscle spasms, and aches and pains. Negatives may include dry eyes and cottonmouth.

223,NYC Diesel,"Sour Diesel meets an original Afghani or Hawaiian strain in this sativa-dominant hybrid (60:40 sativa/indica ratio). NYC Diesel carries strong sativa genes from its Sour Diesel mother, while the father plant was either indica- or sativa-dominant. This strain is a good choice for busy days and social occasions, as it provides a peppy cerebral high with strong energy. THC levels can exceed 21%, making this a particularly potent medical option. CBD concentration, on the other hand, is very low, typical for a sativa. The high comes with a strong shot of euphoria, a mood boost, and a spark of creativity. It's most useful when treating anxiety, chronic pain, and depression. It can also be an effective appetite stimulant. Negative effects are limited, especially paranoia, and that makes this an ideal choice for patients suffering from chronic anxiety. A strong, pungent fuel flavor predominates in this Diesel descendant, along with additional chemical notes. NYC Diesel should be relatively easy to find in New York State, though it's probably more popular on the West Coast, especially in California, Oregon, and Washington State.

253,Ogre,"Ogre is a strong indica dominant strain, which has an indica-sativa ratio close to 70:30 while some readings have gone as high as 90:10. What this implies is that the strain is very strong with very powerful effects that accompany most indica strains. The high from this strain is instant and hits hard. What can best be described as a cerebral high, this strain knocks you out and is not recommended for use by novice smokers. The smoke is smooth and the heavy high that follows is enough to be used as an instant painkiller for people suffering from chronic pain. This includes arthritis, anxiety, ADD and even migraines. In terms of aroma, this strain is pungent with almost no undertones. If you smell closely enough, you can hardly make out any citrusy-piney undertones. The taste, however, is amplified and brings out the citrus. There is no special aftertaste either. In terms of appearance, the strain is a simple mossy green with very few orange hairs with a noticeable white texture if examined closely.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,70% Indica,30% Sativa,18.5,Earthy Citrus Peppery Diesel Sweet Lemon Skunky Pungent,Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sleepy Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sleepy

That means this strain could be useful in treating seizure disorders and other medical problems that respond to CBD, though patients with these conditions should consult their providers about the usefulness of Sour Cream. This strain is also recommended for the treatment of anxiety, stress, and mental fatigue. The nugs are dark green with brown hairs, while the flavor and aroma have pungent hints of candy, flowers, vanilla, and diesel fuel, a trait acquired from the Sour Diesel parent. Patients who use this strain can probably expect the usual side effects – cottonmouth, watery eyes, and paranoia – though there are few public reports on the subject. This strain isn't particularly popular, on or off the legal market, but it can be found without much trouble in Michigan, Arizona, Colorado, and Washington State.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,23.0,Earthy Citrus Sweet Spicy Tropical Herbal Creamy Berry,Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing

413,Romulan,"Romulan, naturally, gets its name from the hostile alien race in Star Trek. It's a fitting history, as outer space is the perfect backdrop for this indica strain out of British Columbia. Topping out at 20-24% THC, Romulan is quite potent. It's almost pure indica with a small amount of the sativa-dominant White Rhino hybrid, but its full origins are a mystery. Romulan has a sweet earthy smell and taste, with hints of pine and citrus. It produces a deeply relaxed body high with a dreamy, floating sensation. Like all indicas, Romulan can be effective at treating anxiety, though it's best for pain. It's also used to treat depression and lack of appetite. Couch-lock is common when smoking Romulan, so it's best saved for late nights or rainy days at home. This strain is popular in legal markets in the American West, less so in other regions. Though not exactly a top-shelf strain, Romulan rates well among users, and it's a favorite of many medical marijuana patients. It can be overpowering if used in high concentrations, with possible dizziness, paranoia, and headaches.",Indica,,,22.0,Earthy Citrus Sweet Pungent Spicy Pine Woody,Cerebral Euphoria Happy Hungry Relaxing Sleepy Cerebral Euphoria Happy Hungry Relaxing Sleepy

Island Sweet Skunk smells and tastes exactly as its name implies: sweet and skunky. It also delivers aromatic hints of the tropics. This strain, which won a Canadian award at the High Times Cannabis Cup, is a sativa-dominant hybrid of original Skunk #1, a local California strain known as Sweet Skunk, and an unknown sativa. The sativa/indica ratio is 80:20. This strain is useful in relieving anxiety, depression, nausea, and pain. It can also help with nerve pain, migraines, arthritis, and GI disorders. Dry mouth is very common, but other adverse effects are limited. This strain is most popular in its home territory, British Columbia and Ontario, along with Colorado and the Pacific Northwest. It's much harder to find elsewhere. The cerebral high packs a major mood boost, with feelings of happiness and euphoria.

415,Grape Crush,"The indica genes win out in this hybrid (the exact sativa/indica ratio is unknown), though the sativa keeps the high energized and easy. Grape Crush is a descendant of indica Blueberry parents, so its distinct purple coloring and sweet berry flavor are no coincidence. This strain produces a euphoric, lazy sensation with both head and body effects. The high is happy, focused, and occasionally sleepy. Grape Crush is effective as a treatment for anxiety and stress, as well as sleeplessness, chronic pain, and migraine headaches. Dry mouth is fairly common, as are dry eyes and dizziness. Headaches and paranoia are more limited. THC levels can vary considerably in this strain, but available tests peg them at slightly more than 12%. CBD levels, meanwhile, are just 0.28%, not enough to recommend Grape Crush as a treatment for epilepsy or other disorders that respond to CBD. This strain can be found on legal medical markets in California, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, and Canada. It may appear on the black market in some places, so while it's relatively popular, it isn't exactly a staple among patients.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,12.0,Citrus Sweet Chemical Grape Berry Pungent,Energizing Euphoria Focus Giggly Happy Relaxing Energizing Euphoria Focus Giggly Happy Relaxing

The buds are quite dense and sticky, but incredibly soft at the same time. You will find an abundance of orange, reds and beautiful hues of green. Even though it looks like any other Kush strain, you can immediately identify its aroma due to Jack being a part of the genetics. The smell is unique with its mint pepper chemical scent with hints of vanilla cream, pungent fruit and lemon rind. However, the taste is not as spicy as you would expect it to be, but it is more or less the same as its smell. After smoking the strain, you will immediately feel overwhelmed by a sativa buzz. But then again your body will remain medicated enough due to the Kush found in the strain's genetics. The high gains momentum gradually and you might feel a bit stoned, but it is not something an experienced cannabis user can't handle. The high can easily last anywhere in between two to three hours. Due to its numbing effects, it is often recommended for patients suffering from chronic pains and aches. Additionally, you can also use it to regain your lost appetite.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,30% Indica,70% Sativa,,Lemon Citrus Sweet Pine,Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy
420,Blue God,"This strain is a near-pure indica, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica isn't widely reported. THC and CBD levels are also hard to come by, though reviews suggest it's a relatively potent medical choice. At least one test indicates THC can make up more than 20% of this strain. But the lack of data on CBD content makes Blue God a poor choice for patients who need CBD preparations to treat seizures or other health problems. On the other hand, this is a very good choice for treating irritability, chronic pain, insomnia, and daily stress. The high is largely physical, with a calming body buzz, sleepiness, and couch-lock effects. But there are also limited cerebral qualities, including psychoactive euphoria. Grape and Kush are the dominant notes in the taste and smell of this pungent strain, while the nugs are dark, purple, and sticky. Expect the usual side effects, including dry mouth and watery eyes, though specific reports are scarce. Blue God isn't especially popular, but it sells at medical marijuana dispensaries in California, Oregon, Colorado, Arizona, and British Columbia.",Indica,,,20.0,Earthy Sweet Blueberry Fruity Herbal Berry Pungent,Body High Cerebral Euphoria Hungry Relaxing Sleepy Body High Cerebral Euphoria Hungry Relaxing Sleepy

Still, some patients may find the easy cerebral high very pleasant. The experience is typically clear-headed and creative, with a boost of energy and sociability, and a mood boost. It's best used to alleviate anxiety, depression, irritability, migraine headaches, and everyday stress. Side effects are likely minimal, but expect some dry mouth and dry eyes. The taste includes notes of citrus, must, and spice, while the smell is pungent and spicy with a hint of citrus. Pineapple Jack is available on the medical market in Los Angeles and the rest of Southern California but is likely hard to find anywhere else.

The high is sleepy but psychoactive, with qualities that are both stimulating and deeply relaxing. The flavor is smooth but skunky and fruity, while the aroma is similarly skunky.

986,Purple Nepal,"Lemon Thai was mixed with an unknown original Nepalese strain to create this peppy, potent indica (sativa/indica ration unclear). THC levels vary in Purple Nepal but appear to be quite high, topping 19% in some samples and regularly scoring about 18%. Those numbers mean this strain provides a particularly intense, indica-driven body high with deep physical relaxation, sleepiness, and powerful hunger balanced against creativity, arousal, and upbeat mood. As a result, Purple Nepal is a good strain for treating lack of appetite, inflammation, chronic pain, stress, insomnia, and depression. But it's probably much less effective in treating seizure disorders and other conditions that are alleviated with CBD, as that chemical is definitely in short supply in Purple Nepal. True to its name, this strain produces green and purple buds with brown hairs and generates an earthy grape flavor and smell. Dry eyes are common, and other side effects include cottonmouth, paranoia, dizziness, and limited headaches. Purple Nepal is relatively popular as purps strains go, and patients should be able to find it on the medical marijuana markets in California, Oregon, Washington State, Colorado, and, increasingly, Massachusetts.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,19.0,Earthy Sweet Grape Dank Fruity Lemon Berry,Aroused Creative Euphoria Happy Relaxing Uplifting Aroused Creative Euphoria Happy Relaxing Uplifting

With a 24% THC level, Scarface OG is every bit as intense as it sounds – like the original Scarface from the movies, it comes on mild and sweet, and then takes you for all you've got and knocks you flat out with an MK47. Users describe their high as a powerful cerebral stimulation, with strong feelings of calm and relief as well as an overwhelming hunger. Scarface OG has a sugary sweet taste and a pungent tropical aroma that only serves to sweeten the taste and strengthen your munchies. Because of its high THC level and potent punch, it is not recommended to be used by new patients and should be smoked in small doses to limit potential negative side effects. This bud has a dark green nug decked with golden hairs and frosty trichomes.",Indica,,,24.0,Sweet,Body High Cerebral Relaxing Body High Cerebral Relaxing

1026,Skunk #9,"Skunk #9 is an indica-heavy hybrid, a descendant of original Skunk strains with an unknown sativa/indica ratio. It produces a mostly physical high, with sleepy, relaxing effects and complementary mental relief. This strain is recommended for the treatment of headaches, chronic pain, sleeplessness, and everyday stresses. THC levels aren't widely reported, so it's hard to know how potent Skunk #9 really is, but the few available reports suggest it's quite strong. There's no data about CBD levels, meanwhile, and that means this strain isn't a good choice as medication for patients who require CBD preparations. The dense buds of this strain have lime green leaves, brown hairs, and a layer of trichome crystals. Not surprisingly, Skunk #9 has a smooth but Skunky flavor and smell. If other, more popular Skunk varieties are any guide, cottonmouth should be the most common side effect, though dry eyes, paranoia, and headaches must also be possible. This strain sells in some medical marijuana dispensaries in Southern California, but it's much harder to find in other parts of the United States. It may occasionally appear on the black market but definitely isn't a regular.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,9.0,Skunky,Relaxing Relaxing
1027,Spoetnik #1,"Spoetnik #1 is a rare heavily indica dominant hybrid strain created with unknown parentage. The lack of information about its heritage is likely due to a high level of breeder secrecy, although it has been attributed to a sheer lack of information by some users. Nonetheless, you can expect Spoetnik #1 to bring on a beautiful body high fueled by a moderately high 15-18% THC level that’s perfect for bringing on peaceful dreams at the end of a long day. You’ll feel a slightly euphoric lift at first toke with Spoetnik #1 that infuses you with a sense of happy bliss without lifting your energy level or causing anxiety. A mellow body high comes next, spreading its tingly tendrils through you with waning and ebbing intensity, lulling you into a pleasant state of sleepy relaxation. You’ll be sedated at this point, although not entirely couch-locked and still functional if need be. Thanks to these effects, Spoetnik #1 is often chosen to treat conditions such as chronic pain, stress, and glaucoma or eye pressure. This bud ahs a super dank skunky hash smell with a touch of fresh citrus and florals as the nugs are broken apart. The flavor is very citrusy and skunky with a touch of spicy dank on each exhale. Spoetnik #1 buds have super thick dense long minty green nugs with rich amber hairs and matching crystal trichomes.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,90% Indica,30% Sativa,16.5,Earthy Citrus Dank Hash Skunky Fragrant,Body High Mellow Relaxing Sleepy Body High Mellow Relaxing Sleepy
1028,Cherry Skunk,"Cherry Skunk is a rare indica dominant hybrid strain created through crossing the classic Skunk Dawg with the tasty Poppa Cherry strain. This bud has a flavor just like its name suggests – sweet cherries and spicy skunk! The aroma is a little danker, bringing in earthy spices and herbs to complement the berry skunk overtone. Cherry Skunk buds have round super hairy dusty green nugs with fuzzy orange hairs and a thick blanket of tiny amber colored crystal trichomes. The Cherry Skunk high comes on pretty quickly after your first exhale, hitting you with a sharp increase in energy and a rush of elation. These cerebral effects quickly become introspective and pretty stoney as the high builds, leaving you physically energized and mentally relaxed. You won’t feel sleepy at all in this state – rather, you’ll be fit to hit the outdoors or hang out with friends. Just don’t try anything that requires a lot of brainpower! In combination with its high 18% average THC level, these effects make Cherry Skunk perfect for treating conditions such as mood swings, chronic anxiety or stress, depression, chronic pain, and fatigue.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,70% Indica,30% Sativa,18.0,Earthy Sweet Spicy Cherry Berry Skunky,Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Happy Relaxing Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Happy Relaxing

1031,Gremlin,"THC levels are high in this potent sativa-dominant hybrid, upwards of 20%, while CBD levels are extremely low, just a fraction of 1%. Apart from those details, not much is known about this rare strain, including its exact sativa/indica ratio (it's at least 70:30, possibly higher). But as a sativa, Gremlin is best used for daytime purposes when energy and focus are critical. The head high is alert and relaxed, making this strain a good bet for treating depression, fatigue, stress, and anxiety. It also provides an antidepressant mood boost that can last for hours. Gremlin has a strong, sweet citrus flavor and a similar smell. The buds have a white frosted appearance due to a thick layer of resinous trichomes. This medical strain is worth trying at least once, especially for those with active daily lives, but it's decidedly hard to find. Look for it on the legal markets of the West Coast, but don't expect to see it much of anywhere else.

1033,Incrediberry,"Being a hybrid strain, Incrediberry works for all cannabis users. With an incredible 24% THC content, the strain produces amazing buds to medicate with. The nuggets are bright green in color and quite fresh at the same time. The buds are covered in crystals and are not dry as you would expect them to be. The strain smells great and is a perfect blend of light berry scents that will leave you thunderstruck. As for the taste, it does not disappoint. It is just as good as the smell and easy to distinguish from any other strain you may have smoked before. The strain packs a punch and has a light berry taste that you will keep you coming back for more. The strain is not to be underestimated as it is quite potent and can knock you out for good if you are not careful. The body buzz is quite strong but it will not drain you. You will feel happy and energized which is perfect if you wish to concentrate and focus on the task at hand. But then again, considering its potency it is not recommended to individuals who are new to smoking cannabis. However, Incrediberry is quite effective at treating several medical conditions, like anorexia, muscle spasms, depression and anxiety.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,20.5,Earthy Sweet Chemical Fruity Berry Pungent,Body High Body High
1034,Maui Sunset,"Most patients would have to travel far to see a real Maui sunset, and the same is true of the marijuana version. It's a sativa-dominant hybrid with a sativa/indica ratio of at least 70:30 and as much as 90:10. That means the effects probably focus primarily on the head. But it's impossible to say for sure without actually trying Maui Sunset, since there's next to nothing about it on the public record. There are no reports on its medicinal uses, though anxiety and depression are usually good bets. Likewise there are no tests indicating how much of this plant is THC and how much of it is CBD. If it were an especially potent medical tool, there would probably be more information about Maui Sunset, so the lack of it suggests it's not high in either chemical. It probably shouldn't be used as the only treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD, given the lack of reliable data on that substance. Nobody seems to know what this strain smells, tastes, or looks like, but there are likely tropical notes.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,30% Indica,70% Sativa,20.0,Pine Sweet Citrus Chemical,Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Uplifting Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Uplifting

1036,White Elephant,"There are two strains that use this name, the other being an indica-dominant cross of White Widow and Purple Elephant. This strain, on the other hand, is a sativa-dominant cross of White Rhino and an unknown sativa. The exact ratio of sativa to indica is unclear. THC levels are also a mystery with this strain, though there's a good deal of information about the other White Elephant. But the effects are known to be both physical and mental, with an enjoyable body buzz and an energized boost of euphoria. That makes this strain a good choice for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. It's not ideal for seizure disorders, however, as it's low in CBD, much less than 1%. White Elephant tastes of Kush, with sweet pine notes. The smell is pungent, earthy, and spicy. There's little available data on adverse effects, but dry mouth is common in almost all strains, as are dry eyes. The other White Elephant isn't as hard to find as this one.

It produces a deeply relaxing and sleepy body buzz that can be used to fight a wide range of health problems: migraine headaches, mood disorders, chronic pain, nerve pain, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and tumors, among others. But there are few public reports on how much CBD can be found in this strain, so patients shouldn't rely on it as the sole treatment for seizures or other conditions that can be alleviated with CBD. Dry mouth is the most commonly reported side effect with Platinum Fire OG, but dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia are also possible.

The head buzz is calming but energized, with clear mental focus, creativity, and euphoria. Very little is known about the CBD content of this strain, which means it probably shouldn't be used as the exclusive treatment for epilepsy or other conditions that respond to CBD concentrates. True to its name, Pickle has a distinct dill flavor, while its odor is earthy, musky, and sour. The tiny buds are roughly the size of popped popcorn kernels. This strain isn't popular enough to generate credible public reports of negative side effects, but red eyes and dry mouth are common with most strains.

The high starts with a euphoric head rush that boosts your mood and leaves you feeling insanely happy and at ease. This quickly fades into cloudy introspection and can lead to some psychedelic effects at times. As your spaciness builds, you’ll fall victim to a lazy sleepy state that can knock you flat out if you’re not careful. Because of these effects and its powerful 23% THC level, Confusion Kush is a favorite for treating migraines or headaches, nausea, chronic stress, depression, and mood swings.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,70% Indica,30% Sativa,23.0,Earthy Spicy Herbal Pine Woody,Happy Happy

1165,Kushman OG,"Kushman OG is a sativa dominant hybrid strain that is a specially bred private reserve selection of OG Kush created by renowned grower Kyle Kushman. This bud is a hard one to find on the market and there is very little verified information out about it because of this. Although the exact indica to sativa ratio is unknown, it is known to be a heavy sativa strain in terms of effects. The high starts with a cerebral head rush that launches your mind straight into clear-headed euphoria and a sense of energy. You’ll be motivated and uplifted, ready to conquer anything that comes your way. Other than these effects, very little is known about Kushman OG’s effects. These sativa heavy effects coupled with its powerful 25% average THC level make Kushman OG ideal for more experienced users rather than novices, especially considering that it can cause paranoia in some. This bud is perfect for treating conditions such as mood swings, chronic stress, depression, inattentiveness, and migraines. The smells and flavor of Kushman OG is very much like its parent with strong notes of earthy pine and woody pungency. A fresh spicy herbal scent can be detected as the nugs are broken apart and smoked. These buds have long and lumpy cone-shaped dark forest green nugs with furry dark red hairs and a sparse crystal chunky trichomes.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,25.0,Earthy Sweet Pungent Spicy Herbal Pine Woody,Energizing Euphoria Uplifting Energizing Euphoria Uplifting
1166,Vortex,"This is a sativa-dominant medical marijuana strain with the indica/sativa ration of 20:80. This is a hybrid strain that was first created by TGA Genetics by crossing 'Apollo 13 Strain' with 'Space Queen Strain'. This strain won the #1 rank in ""2010 Cannabis Cup"" and ""2010 High Times Medicinal Cup"". The plant is featuring neon-green colored buds that would lately become resin-coated and snowy-white colored ones. They will be colored by fiery orange-colored hairs all over. Typically, the plant would grow like a vine with its weaker stems. This strain became more popular due to its taste and smell which are similar to fruit mixture. The taste of Vortex will have the traces of mango and lemon in addition to the spices and diesel fuel. The aroma will be fruity with the tropical punch. The THC content of this strain is nearly 18% with the CBD count of 0.59% and a CBN count of 0.8%. This high THC content of the strain could produce a two-hour high. Vortex is found to be a good afternoon strain which could relieve the patients from migraine. This is also found to be advantageous for the people who are fighting depression, anxiety and stress.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,20% Indica,80% Sativa,18.0,Mango Citrus Sweet Sour Tropical Fruity Lemon,Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy

1168,Dark Star,"Dark Star, also known as DarkStar, is a pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100) that comes with relatively modest THC levels but several good medical uses. This strain is apparently the result of a cross between two popular originals, Purple Kush and Mazar-i-Sharif. Tests suggest THC levels can top 19%, putting this in the medium range as far as potency is concerned. The few available CBD tests show that chemical is scarce in this strain, too scarce to recommend Dark Star as treatment for epilepsy of other conditions that respond to CBD preparations. The indica genes in this strain produce a calming physical buzz with euphoria, happiness, and some limited cerebral effects. It's a good source of medicine for chronic body pain, everyday stress, and lack of appetite, as it can generate a powerful case of the munchies. The flavor and aroma of Dark Star both have strong, sweet notes of coffee and soil. There isn't much information on side effects, but patients should expect at least some of the usual culprits: dry mouth, dry eyes, paranoia, dizziness, and headaches. Available in both Europe and the United States, this strain sells best in Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Michigan, Spain, and the Netherlands.",Indica,,,19.0,Earthy Pungent Grape Spicy Herbal Berry Pine Woody,Body High Cerebral Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sleepy Body High Cerebral Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sleepy
1169,Louis OG,"Louis OG is an indica dominant strain with 20% THC content, which is renowned for generating a spacey mind-warp along with a strong body-buzz. If you get your hands on the strain, you will come to realize it smells skunky and sweet and tastes just about the same, but has a lemony ting to it. However, it is quite light on the throat and its aroma is something you would like to have around the room all day regardless of how it may smell. Additionally, it tastes even more pungent, but should keep you coming back for seconds. The fluffy nugs are light green in color and look quite tempting but should not be underestimated. After smoking the strain, you will notice that the effects kick in almost immediately. The effects start off with very strong mind and body relaxation that grows and continues to increase into even stronger cerebral and euphoric effects. You will feel most of these effects behind the eyes and in the frontal lobe of the brain. Do not be surprised if you feel weighed down and are caused to lock into your couch. The strain has a lot of medical uses and can be used by patients suffering from panic disorders, eating disorders, chronic pain, nausea, seizures and even Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is safe to say it is a potent marijuana strain that has numerous medical uses which explains why it is a favorite amongst some of the most popular recording artists including B-Real and Snoop Dog.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,20.0,Lemon Pine,Body High Cerebral Happy Body High Cerebral Happy

1174,Sour Diesel #2,"The strain is a sativa dominant hybrid with an acceptable 16% THC content. With a 10:90 indica/sativa ratio the strain does not disappoint. Sour Diesel #2 has some of the densest buds, which are completely wrapped with orange-pinkish hairs. Additionally, it has petals, which are dark green in color and at times can easily be mistaken for a charred color. The aroma is overpowering with a hint of pine, which is dominated with a heavy/thick earthy-diesel smell. As for the taste, it is not as earthy as you would expect it to be. What is really interesting is that the taste is more sour and is quite pleasant with a diesel flavor that will do more than appeal to your taste buds. Sour Diesel # 2 is not your usual sativa strain. Rest assured it will not knock you out but it provides a nice clear headed high. You will feel extremely euphoric and happy, which is never a bad thing of course. But one of the best things about the strain is that it numbs your body and can help you overcome chronic aches and pains as well.

1179,Purple Dragon,"Purple Dragon is a mixture of Blue Dragon, a sativa-indica hybrid, and Purple Urkle, a powerful indica favorite. The exact balance of indica and sativa is unclear, but it's known to be indica-dominant, producing calming but euphoric high with happiness, drowsiness, and powerful hunger. The effects start in the head and then move to the body. THC levels are very high, at least 21% in publicly available lab results. Surprisingly, then, CBD levels are also relatively high, between 1% and 2%. That means Purple Dragon may be useful in the treatment of seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to CBD. It's also recommended for treating anxiety, low mood, physical fatigue, inflammation, migraine headaches, mood disorders, chronic pain, and insomnia. Both the flavor and smell of this strain contain notes of flowers, sage, and spice, while the buds have a combination of purple, green, and orange hues. Dry mouth is the only widely reported negative effect from using Purple Dragon, though dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia are also possible. Though it isn't on many top 10 lists, this strain sells fairly well in Arizona, California, Washington State, and British Columbia.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,21.0,Sweet Floral Spicy Skunky Sage Pine,Euphoria Happy Relaxing Euphoria Happy Relaxing
1180,Purple Rhino,"White Rhino, a well-known near-pure indica, and the beloved original Mendocino Purps, an indica-heavy hybrid, were crossed to make this delightful hybrid, itself an indica-heavy hybrid. The exact ratio of indica to sativa is unclear, but THC levels are high in Purple Rhino, reaching 20% in some analyses. On the other hand, CBD levels are very low, far less than 1%, too low to recommend this as a good source of medicine for seizure disorders and other conditions that can be treated with CBD. But the calming high, a mix of both body and cerebral effects, is effective in alleviating anxiety, depression, muscle spasms, chronic pain, and insomnia. Though it's fine any time of day, Purple Rhino is most effective at night, inducing deep relaxation and strong couch-lock effects. The buds are light green in color, with purple and amber strands and a heavy coat of trichomes. This strain has a sweet, distinctive flavor of berries and citrus, with a similar aroma. Side effects aren't widely reported, but it's a safe guess that dry mouth is one of them. Bloodshot eyes and paranoia may also be possible. This strain is decidedly not popular, as it's hard to find pretty much everywhere in the United States.

1183,Dutch Crunch,"With origins in Holland and California, Dutch Crunch is a delightful combination of the sativa Jack Herer and Dutch Treat, a popular indica-dominant hybrid. It has a sativa/indica ratio of 20:80, so the body effects dominate. THC concentrations have been measured at greater than 21%, making this an especially potent medical choice. CBD levels, on the other hand, are less than 2%, so this isn't recommended as a treatment for epilepsy or other diseases that respond to CBD. The body buzz is powerful and calming, leading to a deeply relaxed experience. It's best saved for late at night or rainy days. Dutch Crunch can be used to relieve the symptoms of fatigue, pain, and anxiety, while it's also a good appetite stimulant for patients who need to gain weight. Expect a smooth pine flavor and a fruity, minty pine smell. Negative effects aren't widely reported, but likely include cottonmouth and dry eyes.

It has moderate THC levels, between 14% and 16% in available samples, making it a great choice for first-time patients and occasional tokers. CBD levels are unclear, but reports suggest the chemical is too scarce to recommend Special Queen for treatment of conditions that respond to CBD, such as pediatric seizure disorders. The strain is good, however, as a medication for anxiety, sleeplessness, and chronic nerve pain. The indica-driven effects are mostly physical, producing a calming, happy body high with accompanying mental relief. Special Queen has a musky, Skunky flavor, and it smells of citrus and tealeaves. The buds have a lime green hue and brown hairs. There aren't many public reports of side effects associated with this strain, but it's probably safe to expect watery eyes and cottonmouth, as well as possible paranoia.

1212,Ingrid,"A relative rarity, Ingrid is a cross between the original Royal Cheese strain from the United Kingdom and Hash Plant, both indica-dominant hybrids. Its THC levels, which don't get any higher than 19%, keep it from entering the realm of truly potent strains. But it hits fast and delivers a pleasant, sleepy body high fueled by its indica genes. Though not a great daytime choice, this strain is just right for a night spent vegging in front of the TV. The flowers look almost neon green, while the taste is sweet and pungent. Ingrid produces a strong, skunky odor. This strain is pretty much unheard of outside California, so good luck finding it. If you can, it may be useful in relieving insomnia, anxiety, mood disorders, PTSD, ADHD, and stomach problems. Dry mouth is likely, while dry eyes and paranoia are possible but less likely. The indica genes are dominant in this plant, but it's unclear exactly how dominant they are; Royal Cheese has a 25:75 sativa/indica ratio, while Hash Plant has a 20:80 ratio.

Those genetics show in the indica-fueled body high, which is deeply calming and happy with increased sociability. This strain is recommended for patients seeking treatment for anxiety, stress, pain, PMS, and lack of appetite, as it induces powerful hunger. THC levels aren't widely reported, but So Gouda is rumored to be only moderately potent. CBD numbers are similarly scarce, but that alone suggests this strain shouldn't be used to relieve the symptoms of seizure disorders or other problems that respond to CBD preparations. The light, airy bud is light green with a thin dusting of trichomes on the surface. So Gouda has a mild, sour Kush flavor and a Skunky aroma reminiscent of ammonia. Details about negative effects are hard to come by, though cottonmouth, dry eyes, and paranoia are usually the most common.

1228,Butterscotch,"Butterscotch is a medical Indica strain that is said to have an aroma unlike any others. The smell of actual butterscotch can be scented when a bag or container of this strain containing 18.47% THC is opened. The buzz you are going to get is classically Indica: Body-sedating and mind-calming. Medical patients use butterscotch mostly to alleviate the symptoms of anxiety, PMS, appetite loss, and insomnia. Strictly an Indica strain, its sedative effects are totally supreme and a couchlock can potentially be induced, which may not be a bad thing at the end of a stressful and busy week at work. Not recommended for use during the day as a medicinal smoke because the effects are so weighty. With a lovely orange color that is almost too pretty, and an aroma match with its namesake ice cream topping, the only downsides said to occur from this strain include the commonly expected dizziness, dry eyes, and dry mouth.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Citrus Sweet Diesel Candy Lemon Lime Nutty,Aroused Euphoria Giggly Happy Sociable Aroused Euphoria Giggly Happy Sociable

1230,Jack Flash,"Jack Flash is an indica-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ration of 70:30) with THC levels reaching as high as 20%. That makes this a very potent strain for patients seeking a body high with psychedelic effects and a euphoric boost.

It's best known for the speed of the high, which hits almost instantly, a result of this strain's Jack Herer genetics. While THC levels are high, CBD levels are something of a mystery: This definitely isn't recommended as a CBD strain, but the exact percentage of CBD is unknown. Jack Flash smells of earth and citrus and has a sweet flavor. The high is multi-faceted, with deep body relaxation, euphoria, energy, and creativity, along with a strong happy feeling. It provides relief to patients suffering from anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. It's also good for ADHD, anorexia nervosa, and migraines.

1235,El Diablo OG,"Also known simply as Diablo OG, is named after the Spanish word for ""the devil."" It isn't exactly that, but it's definitely an effective medical strain. THC concentration can reach 20%, while CBD levels are less than 1%, making this a less-than-ideal choice for treating seizures or other conditions that respond to this cannabinoid. El Diablo OG has a sativa-to-indica ratio of 60:40, so the high is largely cerebral, with clear-headed effects, a strong dose of euphoria, and a moderate body buzz. Medically speaking, this strain is helpful with chronic pain, anxiety, insomnia, and migraine headaches. Dry mouth, as usual, is the most common side effect. Dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia are also possible, though less likely. El Diablo descends from OG Kush, one of the world's best-known strains, Blueberry, Grapefruit, and an unknown African plant. The resulting flavors taste of the soil and grapefruit, combined with a pungent plant's aroma. The appearance usually has a middle-of-the-road green hue. This strain is very popular but unfortunately, rather hard to find. It's most common in California, Oregon, Arizona, and Colorado. It can be found on the black market, and it's worth trying if it comes around.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,20.0,Earthy Grapefruit Citrus Pungent Herbal Pine Woody,Body High Cerebral Euphoria Uplifting Body High Cerebral Euphoria Uplifting

1237,Critical Neville Haze,"THC levels are high in this tropical sativa, topping 24% in some tests. That makes for a potent head high with energizing effects. Euphoria is strong, along with happiness. Critical Neville Haze is a useful medical tool in treating anxiety, depression, and general life stress. The indica genes may also provide some physical pain relief. It's not clear exactly what percentage of this strain is sativa, but the indica genes are definitely in the minority. This strain has a woody taste and aroma with coffee flavoring. Negative effects aren't entirely clear, but they likely include cottonmouth and red eyes. Don't look to Critical Neville Haze for CBD; those levels are very low, making this a less-than-ideal treatment for conditions that respond to that chemical. This strain is a cross between Neville Haze, a sativa-dominant hybrid, and Critical Bilbo, an indica-dominant hybrid. Despite its illustrious heritage, Critical Neville Haze is not a particularly popular strain. It's probably easiest to buy on medical markets in the American West or in Europe, but details of its availability are very hard to come by.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Coffee Woody,Aroused Euphoria Happy Aroused Euphoria Happy

1241,Rainbow,"THC values in this especially powerful strain can top 22%, while CBD numbers are much lower. That cannabinoid makes up about 0.49% of this strain, which means it probably shouldn't be used to treat seizures without other, more effective medication. But it's a highly versatile medical tool and can be used to treat both mental and physical disorders: anxiety, depression, PMS, GI distress, migraines and other headaches, muscle spasms, nausea, and pain. Rainbow is an indica-heavy hybrid with a sativa/indica balance of 20:80, the result of a cross between Blueberry and Dance Hall. The high, often quite strong, creates a happy case of the giggles, a tingly sensation, and a potent dose of euphoria. The aroma is sweet, as is the taste, with hints of flowers and honey. Rainbow gets its name from its multi-colored nugs, which are covered in a glossy layer of trichomes. It sells best on the legal medical markets in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Montana. It may also appear on the black market, but it isn't very common in most places.

But the effects follow the indica genes, producing a spacey, sleepy effect that induces deep relaxation. Super Lemon Skunk is an effective medical choice for patients who want to relieve chronic pain and alleviate insomnia. It's less effective for patients who need CBD treatment, including those with seizure disorders. This strain has a sweet lemony flavor, with a similar smell. The real selling point of Super Lemon Skunk, though, is its potency, with a high that can last as long as four hours. Side effects are largely unknown, though it's a safe bet that dry mouth is among them.

Keeping this in mind, it is quite potent and is not recommended to first time medical marijuana users. The name itself explains its aroma as it smells like mature cheddar and is carried over into the flavor as well. The smell will no doubt stink up the place and the taste is quite terrible as it is earthy, mossy with pine undertones. But if you do plant to smoke this strain, it would be a good idea to do so in the night. Exodus Cheese is one of those strains provides a damp aftertaste. After smoking the strain, you will feel a sedating stoner feeling set in.

It's apparently best used to treat physical symptoms, including inflammation, migraines, and chronic pain. Adverse effects may include dry eyes and dry mouth, though there are few reports on the subject. It may be possible to find this medical strain in some California dispensaries, but elsewhere it's pretty rare.

1568,Leilani Chow,"Good luck finding much info on where this rare, mellow indica-heavy hybrid sells. If anyone has it, it's probably a legal medical dispensary on the West Coast or in Colorado. Strains sometimes appear in unlikely places, so it's possible Leilani Chow occasionally circulates on the black market, but it definitely doesn't happen very often. The lack of data makes it hard to say how much of this strain is indica and how much of it is sativa, though the indica genes clearly dominate. That's apparent in the physical high, which is both calming and euphoric. It's difficult to know what percentage of Leilani Chow is THC and what percentage is CBD, though based on the lack of information, it's safe to assume CBD levels aren't very high; strains with strong CBD content are usually better known than this. Medical uses include eating disorders, wasting, chronic pain, and sleeplessness. The smell is sweet, like candy, and pleasantly tropical. The taste is also tropical, with spicy undertones.

There are also sweet candy notes in both the flavor and aroma. The effects are modest, as this strain has THC levels between 13% and 15% in some tests. What it lacks in THC, it definitely doesn't make up for in CBD: That chemical has a concentration of less than 1%, making Bazooka Joe a less-than-ideal choice for seizure disorders.

That means an energized, euphoric head high with a mood boost and increased sociability. It can be used to treat depression, anxiety, headaches, and insomnia, an effect of the limited indica genes.

Creativity, energy, euphoria, and happiness are all common. The medical properties of this strain make it an effective option for treating anxiety, depression, mood disorders, PMS cramps, inflammation, migraine headaches, and nausea.

With original Afghani and Pakistani parents, Pez boasts THC levels between 15% and 20%, though some samples have tested above 23%. CBD is much, much lower, too low to make this a good choice for treating epilepsy and other conditions that require that chemical.

The taste is fresh and is also reminiscent of diesel. THC is relatively abundant in this strain, topping 17% in at least one publicly available test.

It's hard to say how much THC can be found in this strain, as few tests are publicly available, but Platinum Champagne is rumored to be quite powerful. It isn't known to contain large amounts of CBD, however, and that fact recommends against using this strain to medicate conditions that require CBD extracts, such as severe seizure disorders.

The ratio of sativa to indica is 25:75, so the high – what there is – is mostly body-oriented (the ratio in the original Cannatonic is 50:50). Cannatonic #7 has a fresh but pungent pine aroma; it tastes of pine. Medical uses include GI distress, muscle spasms, nausea, and epilepsy. It's prized for its high CBD content, though the THC level is too high for use in children with seizure disorders. Dry mouth isn't unheard of, but negative effects are rare, making this a good strain for those with low tolerance for side effects. Cannatonic #7 is most popular on the West Coast, in Canada, and in Michigan. It's much harder to find on the black market.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Pine Pungent,Body High Relaxing Body High Relaxing
1603,Kurple Fantasy,"Kurple Fantasy is an indica dominant strain (80:20 indica / sativa ratio) with an impressive 23% THC content and 0.7% CBD levels. The buds show off incredible hues of purple while being covered by crystal trichomes. It has been speculated that the strain is a cross between Purple Urkle and OG Kush, but it cannot be said for certain as its lineage is lost to history. That being said, it is extremely potent and tastes and smells like grapes and blueberries. The strain is a bit of a creeper. Its effects start creeping from the back of your head until it makes its way behind your eyes. This feeling and sensation can last for a couple of minutes before it is dispersed into a euphoric body buzz that will relax your body. It is perfect for patients who are using such a strain for the very first time. You will eventually feel as though you are floating until you begin zoning out. A few bowls of this strain is more than enough to knock you out, which is why it is recommended for night time use. It is also perfect for individuals suffering from nausea, stress and anxiety.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Sweet Diesel Grape Fruity Berry Skunky,Body High Creative Energizing Euphoria Happy Relaxing Body High Creative Energizing Euphoria Happy Relaxing
1604,Cherry Lime Rickey,"The cherry lime rickey is a unique hybrid cannabis strain. It is neither a sativa or indica strain since its sativa/indica ration is 60:40. The hybrid strain is a result of crossing the Cherry lime haze and sweet cross strain. It is just slightly more towards the sativa side given its slightly skewed ratio. It should be noted that this is a rare clone only strain and cannot be found naturally. It has very high THC, CBN and CBD levels (26.76, 1.13 and 3.95% respectively). The only confirmed medicinal use of this strain is the treatment of various types of anxieties and depression. The high achieved is mellow in the beginning but as more smoke is inhaled, it makes the smoker feel relaxed and provides an elated feeling of happiness. The only distinguishable aroma of the cherry lime rickey is, as the name suggests, of cherry. When inhaled, the smoke is warm and smooth. The taste is mostly fruity. It feels like one is slurping down iced cherry smoothie (without the guilt). The appearance of this the cherry lime rickey is nothing spectacular. It is simply a swampy shade of green with little or no texture.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,40% Indica,60% Sativa,,Cherry,Euphoria Giggly Happy Euphoria Giggly Happy
1605,Oro OG,"THC levels can exceed 18% in this strain, which is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an unknown balance of sativa and indica. Not much is known about it, though its CBD levels are reportedly very low, less than 1%, which is too low to recommend Oro OG for treatment of health problems that respond to that cannabinoid, such as severe epileptic disorders. The sativa genes lead to a strong cerebral experience mixed with more limited physical qualities. Expect creativity, energy, euphoria, mental focus, and happiness, together with couch-lock effects. These traits make Oro OG an effective tool in the medical treatment of anxiety, low mood, mood disorders, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. The flavor is reportedly spicy, and the nugs are dense and light green with orange hairs, but not much is known about how this strain tastes. There are few patient reports of adverse effects with Oro OG, but as usual, watery eyes, and cottonmouth are probably the most common. Club Oro, a medical marijuana dispensary, was the birthplace of this strain, which can still be found there. But elsewhere Oro OG is a rarity.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,16.5,Spicy Woody Earthy Herbal,Body High Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Body High Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy
1606,Don Cristo's Brainfreeze,"Being a hybrid strain, Don Cristo's Brainfreeze is not a force to be reckoned with. Even though it is the predecessor of Don Cristo, it has plenty to offer in terms of an all-time high. The strain will not disappoint, that is for certain. With 21% THC content, the strain produces average buds that are not as exquisite or beautiful as other hybrid strains. They are usually brown in color with orange hairs and gold hues that might appeal to some individuals. The strain got its name for good reason, it is primarily because it delivers a sensation blend of tobacco and cigar flavors for those who are particularly fond of the two. The strain and its high are not extraordinary but it makes the best use of its indica/sativa heritage so that you can enjoy the best of both worlds. The strain is not a creeper, you will feel high in a minute or so but its effects will make you feel sleepy. This is one of the reasons why you should use it as a nighttime strain. Rest assured, your next day will be wonderful and will leave you feeling energized. Considering its effects, there should be no surprise why Don Cristo's Brainfreeze should not be used to treat nausea, tumors and chronic pains and aches.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,21.0,Tobacco,Body High Body High
1607,Nite Life,"Take the name of this indica-dominant hybrid literally: Nite Life is a great strain for relaxing and sleeping late at night. The exact balance of sativa and indica isn't clear, as the genetics of this strain are obscure at best. Nor, for that matter, are the THC or CBD contents of this strain. But Nite Life is known to be rather potent, causing a body-oriented high with intense couch-lock effects. The feeling is predominantly relaxed and sleepy, making this an ideal strain for insomnia and anxiety relief. It's also good at treating muscle spasms and chronic pain. This strain has a unique woody flavor and a pungent, earthy cheese smell. Patients who suffer from insomnia or other sleep disorders may find great comfort in Nite Life's calming physical effects. On the other hand, this isn't a very good strain for daytime activities. It might be found on some legal markets in the American West, but very few dispensaries appear to sell it. It would be an even greater challenge to buy it off the black market, especially from local growers.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Earthy Cheese Pungent Woody,Body High Relaxing Body High Relaxing
1608,Purple Dogshit,"Don't let the name fool you; Purple Dogshit is actually a very useful medical strain that can help with anxiety, stress, and depression. Very little is known about this rarity, including its exact genetic balance. But it is known to be an indica-dominant hybrid descended from Dogshit and Purple Urkle. THC levels top out at about 19%, while CBD levels are negligible. Purple Dogshit owes its appearance and its flavor to its Purple heritage. This strain tastes of grape and has a dark purple appearance with flecks of brown, green, and gold. It smells similar to its stinky Dogshit parent, but not nearly so powerful. The high is immediate, with a soothing body buzz. It lasts for up to an hour and a half and provides deep relaxation and stress relief. Along with some mental health disorders, Purple Dogshit is a highly effective treatment for pain and can help insomniacs sleep. Negative effects aren't well-documented, tough dry mouth and red eyes are common with almost all marijuana strains. This strain is available on the medical market in Washington State but is rare elsewhere.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,85% Indica,15% Sativa,15.0,Floral Grape,Body High Relaxing Sleepy Body High Relaxing Sleepy
1609,CPL,"A genetic combination of an indica heirloom and a Land Race South Asian plant, CPL is a third position winner of the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup. The CPL plant has big hairy nuggets with long pistols and a coating of crystals. Indica dominant with an estimated 80 – 85 % indica, this strain can cure headaches and clear sinus within minutes. It can also relieve pain in tired joints. The strain works great for those who suffer from migraines, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, arthritis, muscle spasms, inflammation, PMS and even cancer. This effective and potent pain reliever has a smooth and rich diesel aroma with fruity undertones. The strain offers a pungent diesel like flavor with hints of fruity sweetness with every draw. A delight for veteran smokers, CPL will give them a strong body buzz. The psychoactive effect stays longer and aids sleep, making it an ideal evening or night time strain. Light smokers looking for effective pain relief can enjoy the calming effect offered by this strain in small doses and benefit from its useful and exclusive medicinal properties.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Diesel Fruity,Body High Body High
1610,Ogre Kush,"Ogre Kush is an indica-dominant strain with a 70/30 ratio and a cross between Master Kush and Bubba Kush. The average THC level observed in Ogre Kush is 13% and CBD level of 0.36%. This strain creates body buzz, feelings of euphoria and drowsiness. Yet, it is a substantial form of calming agent. In terms of flavor, it is a mixture of citrus, earthy and lemon hints. Likewise, it has a mixed and arousing aroma of the same three components. If you are experiencing any one or more of the symptoms such as anxiety, depression, lack of appetite, migraines, pain, seizures, sleeplessness or stress, then this is the perfect strain for you. Ogre Kush must be used during later parts of the day or once you do not have any more tasks. This is because its sleep-inducing and appetite-boosting properties may act as hurdles when you are working. Some of the most prevalent side effects of using this strain are no different from others. You may experience dryness of mouth and eyes, dizziness, paranoia and headaches. Generally, this strain has nine weeks of flowering time and produces high yield at the end of the day.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,24.0,Earthy Sweet Spicy Herbal Pungent,Euphoria Happy Relaxing Euphoria Happy Relaxing
1611,Afghani Grand Daddy,"Afghani Grand Daddy is a 100% indica strain. It has an amazing 21% THC content, which should interest most experienced cannabis users. The buds are dense and dark green in color. However, the strain is sticky. Breaking down the buds will make it even stickier than it already was. You will notice purple hues on the stems of the plants. Additionally, the buds are covered by an unusual layer of milky white trichomes. As for the aroma, it is fresh and light. It smells mildly sweet and is quite similar to Grand Daddy Purple in this regard. That being said, it tastes just about the same and will leave a sweet aftertaste in your mouth, which is something to look forward to. The Afghani Grand Daddy has been created using two of the finest indica plants available on the planet. This explains why it has an amazing body buzz with cerebral effects. The high will feel like a warm blanket covering your body. What is really interesting about the strain is that you will remain clear headed throughout the entire duration of the buzz. It tends to be stronger than most indica strains you might have already tried before. But that is not all, as the strain is perfect for treating several medical conditions like anxiety, chronic pains, migraines and even anorexia.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,21.0,Spicy Kush Sweet,Body High Relaxing Body High Relaxing
1612,JR,"JR is also known as Route 66, it is an indica dominant strain with a 75:25 indica/sativa ratio. The strain originates from Northern California and there is very little known about it. What is really interesting is that nobody actually knows who bred it and how it came into being. But one thing is for certain, it offers an exceptional high due to its amazing 17% THC content. The buds are not as dense as other strains you may have come across before. However, it does taste extremely fruity and sweet. After smoking the strain, you will come to realize you are dealing with a one hit wonder. Jolly Rancher is not a creeper and it's a fact (you've been warned). The body high is overwhelming and outdoes its cerebral effects. But you have to keep in mind that the strain is recommended for night time use. You will feel numb and will begin noticing symptoms of couch-lock. But then again it is not as bad as it may seem, as the strain and its effects are just what patients suffering from insomnia and chronic pains/aches need.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,75% Indica,25% Sativa,17.0,Citrus Peppery Sweet Blueberry Menthol Floral Sour Cherry Fruity Berry Lime Mint,Creative Euphoria Giggly Happy Relaxing Creative Euphoria Giggly Happy Relaxing

1614,Platinum NASA,"The folks behind the moon landing couldn't have produced a sleepier, more spacey, or more effective combination of Fire OG and San Fernando Valley OG. It's a pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100), and the high shows it. The body buzz is deeply relaxing and comes with intense couch-lock. These effects make Platinum NASA a good choice for treating anxiety, nausea, and chronic pain. CBD and THC numbers are hard to come by, but it's rumored to produce a very potent high. The lack of data on CBD levels means this strain shouldn't be used as the only form of treatment for conditions that require CBD, including epileptic disorders. The nugs of Platinum NASA are bright green with red hairs, while the strain produces a sweet flavor with hints of lemon and spice, and a citrusy pine smell. There are few reliable reports regarding the side effects patients can expect when using this strain, but dry mouth and red eyes are usually the most common, along with paranoia. Platinum NASA is decidedly rare, though it can be found in at least one San Diego medical marijuana dispensary.",Indica,,,,Citrus Sweet Spicy Lemon Pine,Body High Relaxing Sleepy Body High Relaxing Sleepy

Packing your lungs with this will light them up like the fourth of July, but if you can handle it, you will find heaven. This is one strain which is definitely not for the amateur. With an extremely high THC content, it has a pine mixed with wintergreen aroma that is as utterly pleasing as the taste of molasses. Even though no one would call it smooth, its extreme potency makes it a much wanted commodity in the medical marijuana community. Along with being used as a pain reliever, it is also used to relieve stress. Toking on this will make you feel like a desert has invaded your mouth and it will give you a severely debilitating couchlock, but the feeling of peace and tranquility is amazing.

1619,Fruit of the Gods,"This divinely inspired medical strain is a sativa-dominant cross of Northern Lights #5, Skunk #1, and Haze, all classics in their own right. The exact ratio of sativa/indica isn't clear, but Fruit of the Gods is probably at least 70% sativa. The THC contents of this strain vary but can reach as high as 21%. Typically for a sativa, CBD levels are very low, too low to recommend this strain to patients who need that form of marijuana treatment. The high is focused on the head, with a strong shot of mood enhancement and a high degree of mental clarity. The dominant feelings in this creeper high are relaxation and happiness. The flavor and aroma of this strain is strongly reminiscent of flowers, with a sweet haze taste. Fruit of the Gods is designed to treat depression, anxiety, fatigue, and chronic body pains. Adverse effects may include dry mouth and dry eyes, while paranoia and other negatives are more limited. Born in Amsterdam, this is a rare strain almost everywhere else, including legal markets in the United States.

The strain has a 17% THC content and it may not appeal to most experienced cannabis users but it should not be underestimated in any way. The buds are ordinary and are dense and sticky with gold hues amidst the greens. As for the taste and smell, it is fruity and sweet. The sweet indica strain is known for its mellow effects. It is the perfect strain to medicate with if you do not plan to leave the house. The strain and its effects tend to last longer and will leave you with an exceptional high that is calming to say the least. Apart from that, a hit or two is more than enough to last you a solid hour without breaking a sweat. However, most experienced will need a bit more before they can actually feel the full force of the strain.

1623,Venus OG,"Venus OG is a long-lasting, and very potent hybrid strain of Tahoe Kush and OG Kush. Due to the THC content being around 25%, the effects of consuming this are almost instantaneous. In appearance, the plant has a range of colors that go from forest green to neon green, with very thick and big buds on it. It has a very strong taste, comparable to a lemon, hash, pine, and skunk. Its aroma is interesting, mixing pine and diesel with a lemony undertone that will soak in your nostrils. You can feel your eyes begin to relax, you become very sociable, get increasingly creative, have racing thoughts, etc. After about an hour of that, you start to feel a strong mind and body relaxation which starts and ends with happiness. The effects of this weed can last for around 1.5 hours to 4 hours.

1624,Crystal Mountain Kush,"Crystal Mountain Kush is a hybrid strain produced by crossing OG Kush and Chem Dawg. The strain's THC content usually varies depending on where it is bought from but it exceeds 20%. The strain produces average buds that do not look like much. They are green in color and have orange hairs seeping through the surface. Additionally, they are fluffy which differentiates the strain from the rest of the hybrid cannabis strains on the market. The taste and smell are no different. However, they are a treat nonetheless. Cannabis users will enjoy a perfect blend of lemon and sour flavors which leaves an exotic aftertaste that lingers in the mouth for quite some time. The strain and its effects start off in the form of a body buzz. However, it is quite calming at the same time. Moreover, some individuals may even feel clearheaded and energized, depending on the usage. You may even get the munchies which is why it would be a good idea to have snacks lying around just in case.

It is a rare product though and that makes it more expensive. It is a hybrid of Jamaican Pearl and Jack Herer. Jack Knife is very smooth tasting and it is sweet. The taste is almost like refined sugar from candy. The smell is forestry with a hint of pine and eucalyptus. The buds this plant creates are very colorful and the smell is very strong but pleasant. The high from Jack Knife lasts a couple of hours and it is very light. Many people use it to take the edge off due to stress or anxiety.

1627,LSD OG,"With strong psychoactive effects and THC levels topping 24%, LSD OG earns its place alongside the real thing. This is a potent indica-dominant hybrid, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica is hard to come by. The indica genes produce deep-body relaxation and stress relief, together with creative, giggly cerebral effects and even occasional psychedelic effects. LSD OG is best used as treatment for depression, chronic pain, and stress. CBD levels may be higher than average, though it's hard to know for sure. But they likely aren't high enough to recommend this as a front-line treatment for seizures. This strain smells and tastes like lemons, with an additional menthol flavor. Side effects aren't widely reported, probably because this strain isn't sold in many places, but dry mouth and dry eyes are likely the most common. LSD OG is very popular among those who have tried it, but they're few in number. Look for it on the West Coast and possibly in Colorado, but don't expect to find it on the American black market anytime soon.

Green Stream is best used for providing relief from stress and anxiety. Depression patients can smoke it without any worry as well as it has no side effects on their system. It can also help in providing relief from insomnia and aids you in sleeping better at night. This strain has an excellent soothing effect on a variety of pains as well, which is why it is perfect for pain management.

Grand Daddy Urkel has dense buds that are purple in color and rich in trichome coverage. The strain extensively borrows from its heritage and offers a taste and aroma unlike any other. It is a mouthwatering treat, to say the least. Even though the taste and aroma are no different, they offer a unique blend of berry and grape flavors. The strain is potent and offers psychoactive effects and is not limited in any way. As soon as you smoke the strain, you will feel its effects take control of your mind and body. You will be able to experience a perfect fusion of physical relaxation and cerebral euphoria, which is indescribable until or unless you give the strain a try. After a few minutes, you may exhibit symptoms of couch-lock. This is why it would be wise to smoke it before you go to bed.

However, having a strain by that name also implies that the strain is particularly popular and effective just as the origin of the name that it seems to have: Naughty Girl Scout Cookies Strain. It has very calming effects on the human body as it makes you euphoric, happy and very creative. It can calm the necessary parts of your brain, which makes it very effective for treating things such as stress, anxiety and depression of any kind. It also helps you deal with a lack of appetite but in some ways, it can also help you with weight loss situations. It has a sweet woody and piney smell and comes in a large assortment of flavors, which are inclusive of flavors such as chocolate, pine, cherry, etc. The flavor of the Naughty Girl Scout Cookies Strain is a sweet and smooth one.

1635,Igzactly Jack,"Igzactly Jack reportedly began as a cut of Platinum Jack Herer, itself a product of the Igzactly 420 medical marijuana dispensary in San Francisco. Named after its creators, Igzactly Jack is a truly rare choice and would be very hard to find outside California's Bay Area. This strain is a sativa-dominant hybrid, but little is widely known about the precise ratio of sativa to indica. The high is mostly cerebral, as the sativa genes suggest, but there is little detailed information on specific effects. But Igzactly Jack is recommended as a treatment for cramps, muscle spasms, and pain. THC and CBD levels are a mystery outside of its home dispensary, but there's no reason to believe this is either a particularly potent or a particularly weak strain. Reports of negative effects are likewise hard to come by, though some patients may experience paranoia, red eyes, or dry mouth. Igzactly Jack has a sweet taste and smell similar to candy, plus notes of pine and spice in the flavor.

1636,Kananga,"This pure – and very rare – African sativa (sativa/indica ratio of 100:0) takes its name from one of the largest cities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Either that or Dr. Kananga, the James Bond villain played by Yaphet Kotto. In any event, Kananga the marijuana strain is an effective treatment for numerous medical conditions, including anxiety, hyperactivity, and inattentiveness. This makes it an ideal choice for patients with mood disorders or ADHD. The high focuses almost exclusively on the mind, a product of Kananga's sativa background. The effects are energized and euphoric, with sharp mental focus and a dose of creativity. Data on the THC and CBD levels in this strain are scarce, but the few available tests suggest neither chemical is abundant: Kananga is roughly 10% THC and less than 1% CBD. The lack of CBD means this strain shouldn't be used to treat seizure disorders or other conditions that require that cannabinoid. Kananga has purple leaves and long, rust-red hairs, along with a frosty layer of trichomes. It smells of flowers and tastes of grapes. This strain is definitely a rarity, at least outside of Africa.

1637,Triple Sour Diesel,"The ""triple sour diesel"" is a versatile, strong and a grade A strain. It is technically a sativa dominant strain but has effects that are similar to indica strains. This strain is a hybrid and a rather unique one. It is the result of crossing not two but three different strains namely the NYC diesel, Sour diesel and OG Kush. This combination of both sativa and indica strains is probably the reason why it exhibits qualities of both types. The strain is potent. It has a THC level around 24%. This results in an instant head buzz that, frankly, is not for everyone. Both novice smokers and people who have or are prone to paranoia should refrain from this strain. The strain has two main medicinal uses which include a supplement for people suffering from ADD and also for people with chronic pains. When smoked, besides providing a strong high, this also makes the smokers senses razor sharp. If one takes a whiff of the specimen, it is easily apparent why the words sour and diesel are part of the name. It smells like combinations of pungent chemical and diesel. Same is the case with the taste. It is sour. Appearances aren't different from the majority of strains.

But physical aspects are also present, making this an effective stress reliever. Palliative OG has a reddish-green appearance and a glossy layer of resinous crystals. THC and CBD levels are unclear, though THC has topped 19% in at least one test. The lack of data about CBD content suggests this strain shouldn't be used as the only source of treatment for seizures or other conditions that respond to CBD.

Its genetic composition is a cross between Northern Lights and Afghani genetics, and it has a CBD level of 0.13 per cent and a more promising THC level of 19 per cent. Also, its CBN level is at 0.52 percent. Cherry Slyder is most often used by patients who are looking for something that can help in overcoming symptoms of nausea, pain, insomnia and anxiety. It provides an overall relaxation in the body by bringing your body muscles at ease, lessening the muscle pain, and relishing a freshly strong appetite. This strain helps a patient in keeping them almost entirely calm, without hampering their focus, but still remaining psychoactive. It is a big plus for this particular medical marijuana strain as you can keep your head held high and stay in control of your conscience in terms of the mind and the body.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,13.0,Pine Cherry Diesel,Focus Relaxing Focus Relaxing
1672,Highwayman,"This sativa-dominant hybrid packs a creative, energized head high with more subtle body effects. Its potency isn't widely known, and the same goes for the exact ratio of sativa to indica. But Highwayman is a crossbreed of William's Wonder and Tang Tang. William's Wonder is an indica-dominant hybrid with THC levels reaching 19%, while Tang Tang is a sativa-dominant hybrid with unknown THC content. Like its sativa parent, Highwayman is rare, even in places where marijuana is legal for medical or recreational use. Apparently an homage to Willie Nelson and the rest of the famed Highwaymen, this strain is best used to treat chronic pain, including migraines and arthritis, along with anxiety and depression. It has a bright green, frosted appearance, with streaks of gold. The nugs appear light but are in fact quite dense. Highwayman smells distinctly of chocolate and coffee. This strain is probably most popular on the West Coast, though its geographic origins are unknown. It's worth a try if you can find it, if only to pay respect to country music's greatest stoners.

1673,Ms. Universe,"Ms. Universe, an offspring of Dess*tar and Space Queen, is known for its sativa-dominant high and complementary body buzz. The effects are psychoactive and uplifting, spurring creativity, delivering a dose of euphoria, and creating a tingly, giggly sensation. Use Ms. Universe as treatment for anxiety, depression, mood disorders, fatigue, lack of appetite, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. THC levels vary, but available tests suggest they're moderately high, at least 14% in some cases. CBD levels, meanwhile, are much lower, less than 1%, which means Ms. Universe may not be a great choice for conditions that require CBD, including childhood seizure disorders. The bud is green with brown hairs and a layer of crystals. Depending on its phenotype, this strain can smell like candy, caramel, cherry, pineapple, or vanilla. The taste is similar. Negative effects are something of a mystery, as there are few public reports, but dry mouth and dry eyes are typical of most strains. Ms. Universe can be found on the medical markets in Oregon and Montana, but it's far from common in other parts of the United States.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,14.0,Citrus Sweet Candy Pineapple Cherry Berry Caramel Vanilla,Body High Creative Energizing Euphoria Giggly Happy Sociable Body High Creative Energizing Euphoria Giggly Happy Sociable
1674,Heavenly Haze,"Heavenly Haze is an indica dominant strain (40:60 sativa/ indica ratio) and is a cross between Haze, Afghani, Northern Lights #5 and Hawaiian. The buds are huge and are packed with resins, thus making it quite appealing for most patients. It tends to offer a haze flavor along with a hint of Afghani. The diverse qualities offered by the strain should do more than appease you. There is no denying that the aroma is slightly metallic, but the taste on the inhale is icy-cold and offers something different from what you would normally expect. After smoking the strain, you will come to appreciate the mellow, relaxing effects with the buzzing energy that comes along with it. But that is not all, as you will also notice an increase in focus and concentration while being clear-headed at the same time. That being said, it is immensely popular among patients suffering from various medical conditions. The strain is highly effective at relieving symptoms of pain, depression, anxiety and irritability. On the other hand, you will not have to worry about any drawbacks, as it has none. But patients are advised to use it as an evening smoke.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,60% Indica,40% Sativa,,Sweet Hash,Focus Relaxing Focus Relaxing
1675,Cherry Assassin,"This indica strain of unknown origin gets its name from its distinct cherry flavor and sweet diesel smell. It's an uncommon choice for medical patients, hard to find almost everywhere. Little is known about it, including the exact ratio of sativa to indica. It's probably a cross of Cherry AK47 and Captain Krypt OG, but nobody seems to know for sure. There is no reliable data on THC contents in this strain, let alone the CBD contents, so it's hard to say with any certainty how Cherry Assassin works on patients. But the high is body-oriented, with a euphoric sleepiness. There are also more limited cerebral effects, including a mood boost. This strain is probably best used to treat pain, insomnia, and anxiety. It's not recommended as a treatment for conditions that respond to CBD, and detailed medical information is scarce. Side effects likely include dry mouth and dry eyes. The bud of Cherry Assassin has a dark green appearance, flecked with gold and coated in trichomes. This strain is a definite specialty, and it may be difficult to find it outside legal markets in the American West.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Sweet Cherry Diesel,Body High Cerebral Euphoria Happy Body High Cerebral Euphoria Happy

1677,isLAnd,"Island is also better known as Sweet Island Skunk and ISS, it is a sativa dominant strain with a 80:20 sativa/indica ratio and can have as much as 19% THC level. However, you have to keep in mind it is not to be confused with Sweet Skunk. It looks quite gorgeous and has dense and long spear shaped flowers that glisten with traces of resin. Additionally, the patchwork is combination of light and dark green along with hints of orange, red, blue and purple. It smells like a grapefruit, which is absolutely mouth watering. The high is quite different from what any other strain you are already used to. It starts behind the eyes and gradually makes its way down to the rest of your body. After fifteen to twenty minutes you may feel hungry, which is shortly followed by analgesic effects. If you are looking for a daytime smoke, you should not look any further. You will still feel energetic and focused. You will come to realize mundane tasks will become much more enjoyable for you. As for the benefits, they are plenty.

1678,Cosmic Brain,"Cosmic Brain is a hard hitting indica dominant hybrid with a 70:30 indica/ sativa ratio. It is a cross between Space Queen and Oregon Afghani, not only is it extremely potent but it is armed with an equally powerful narcotic effect. The strain tastes earthy with hints of Kush and coffee to go along with it. The same can also be the said about its smell as it is more or less the same along with cherry undertones. As for the high, it packs quite a punch. Not only does the strain offer a cerebral high but it calms the body at the same time. It is an excellent way to get some relief from a hectic day, regardless of how stressed you maybe. However, you have to keep in mind that it is recommended for night time use. On the other hand, it does have does have medical uses for patients suffering from stress, sleeplessness and anxiety.

1679,Dragon Lady,"Dragon Lady is a popular strain among those who have tried it, but there aren't all that many of them. It's a combo of Blue Dragon and Flo, both sativa dominant hybrids. Despite the name, THC levels are lower than in most other legal-market strains, but the high is relatively long-lasting, and it promotes creativity. Exact THC numbers are unknown, though Flo reaches top THC levels of just 14-18%. Dragon Lady has a strong plant aroma, with notes of musk and spice. It tastes earthy, sweet, and fresh. The high is relaxing, fueled by the plant's sativa genes, but also slightly cerebral. Expect a mood boost and a mild feeling of euphoria. Dragon Lady is best used for depression, bipolar disorder, and chronic pain. Its calming effects can also be helpful with problems falling asleep. The sativa genes, meanwhile, provide a pleasant cerebral effect that clears the mind. Possible adverse effects include dry mouth and dry eyes, while other problems are more rare. Dragon Lady can be found in California, though even there few dispensaries stock it.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,20% Indica,80% Sativa,16.0,Sweet Herbal,Cerebral Cerebral

1681,God's Green Gift,"God's Green Gift, aka simply as ""God's Gift,"" is an indica-dominant hybrid (10:90 sativa/indica ratio) with THC levels that can top 22%. That makes this one of the strongest choices available for medical relief. CBD levels are negligible, so this isn't a good choice for patients suffering from epilepsy or other conditions that respond to CBD marijuana. The indica-fueled body high is intensely lazy, with a shot of euphoria and a strong mood boost. Sleepiness is also common, making this a great product for treating insomnia. Other medical uses include stress and anxiety, chronic pain, and depression. Anyone looking for deep relaxation should give this effective strain a try. Side effects are possible, as always, especially dry mouth and bloodshot eyes. Other adverse effects are more limited, including dizziness and paranoia. God's Green Gift has a strong pungent odor and a sweet earthy flavor. The dense buds have a vibrant purple hue with a dense layer of trichomes.

1682,Ultra Skunk,"Big Bud was crossed with F2 generation Skunk to create Ultra Skunk, a sativa-dominant hybrid out of Holland. Bred by the famed Dutch Passion seed bank, this strain has a sativa/indica ratio of 60:40 and is highly regarded by patients who have tried it. THC levels are modest, measuring roughly 11% in available tests. CBD numbers are harder to find, but that alone suggests Ultra Skunk isn't a good choice for treating seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to CBD. But it can be very effective as treatment for anxiety, depression, nausea, and bodily pains. The high is decidedly cerebral, reflecting the sativa genes, and delivers a combination of creativity, euphoria, and psychoactive effects. Not surprisingly, Ultra Skunk has a Skunky aroma and flavor, with sweet notes of lemons, limes, and other varieties of fruit. The bud is lime green with hairs of bright orange. There are few public reports of side effects, but probably include cottonmouth, red eyes, and anxiety. Try this medical selection if you can find it, but don't look too hard, as it's a decided rarity outside of Amsterdam.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,40% Indica,60% Sativa,11.0,Sweet Fruity Lemon Lime Skunky,Cerebral Creative Euphoria Cerebral Creative Euphoria
1683,LA Park,"LA Park is an indica dominant hybrid (70% indica/30% sativa) strain with unknown parentage due to breeder secrecy, although it is thought to be related to LA Confidential. This bud is infamous for its insanely high CBD level of 5-10% on average with a low THC level that tops out at 2%. The LA Park high is incredibly relaxing in nature, with a slowly building onset of a heavy duty deep body buzz and full body stone. This body high is incredibly relaxing and drops you into a long-lasting ocean of physical and mental relief and purity. A clear-headed effect is paired with this body stone, leaving you awake while your body melts into utter ease. These effects coupled with its powerful CBD level make this bud perfect for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress or anxiety, extreme muscular pain, depression, and inflammation. LA Park buds have small and incredibly dense grape-shaped nugs with hints of peach and dark orange coloration and long thin transparent hairs. Each nug is completely coated in thick oversized chunky clear trichomes that almost look bubbly. It has an aroma of skunky diesel with a pungent earthy effect and a flavor of sweet spicy skunk with a hint of fuel.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,70% Indica,30% Sativa,2.0,Earthy Sweet Diesel Spicy Skunky Pungent,Body High Relaxing Body High Relaxing
1684,White Indica,"The indica side of this hybrid definitely wins out, delivering a calm, sleepy high ideal for late nights and rainy days indoors. The ratio of sativa to indica is roughly 30:70, though it can reach as low as 10:90. The THC content of White Indica is quite high, about 20% at most, while CBD content is very low, about 0.3%. The exact origins of this powerful strain are not widely known, though it probably descends from original landrace plants found in Afghanistan and Pakistan. White Indica has a strong, pungent earthy flavor with hints of pine. The aroma is similar, while the bud has a white frosted appearance due to a thick layer of resinous trichomes. The indica genes provide a potent, euphoric high with deep body relaxation and a powerful case of the munchies. This strain can be useful in treating anxiety, depression, and insomnia, together with nausea and chronic pain.

1685,Tragic,"Tragic is an indica dominant hybrid strain. It is a cross between Magic and Trainwreck. The strain originates from Humbolt County which is located in California and is primarily used for its medicinal properties. What is really interesting about the medical cannabis is that it smells fruity and sweet. The taste however is nowhere near how the strain actually smells. It in fact tastes like pine with woody undertones. The high from smoking Tragic is unlike any other medicinal strain you may have come across. It will generate a body buzz that will lead to a state of euphoria where you will feel relaxed and happy regardless of how horrible your day already may have been. Moreover, you can expect long lasting effects from the strain, which is unusual since it is an indica dominant strain. That being said, the strain is incredibly useful due to its medicinal properties. It can aid in treating several medical conditions including chronic pains and aches, depression, anxiety and even insomnia. However, you have to keep in mind that the strain is not recommended for first time users and needs to be smoked in controlled doses for maximum effectiveness.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,14.5,Pine Sweet Woody Fruity,Body High Euphoria Relaxing Uplifting Body High Euphoria Relaxing Uplifting
1686,OG Goo,"There isn't much in the way of OG genetics in OG Goo, and for that matter it has no apparent ties to Afgooey, a popular indica-dominant hybrid. Instead, OG Obama is the offspring of Hindu Kush and Blueberry. It's an indica-dominant strain (20:80 sativa/indica ratio). The high, mostly physical, is deeply sedating and relaxing, mixed with more mild cerebral effects. There isn't much available data on THC or CBD contents, but presumably the THC rate is probably notably higher than the CBD level. As a result, OG Goo works very well in treating sleeplessness, chronic pain, and muscle spasms. It's also an effective treatment for anxiety and lack of appetite. Expect a sweet, fruity blueberry taste and aroma, with sour, earthy notes and hints of lemon or pineapple. The bud can have either a bright green or darker green appearance. Side effect information is limited, but dry mouth or bloodshot eyes are likely common. OG Goo is relatively easy to find on the West Coast, where it's popular in California and Oregon, along with the legal medical market in Arizona.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,80% Indica,20% Sativa,,Blueberry Spicy Dank Hash Fruity,Body High Happy Relaxing Body High Happy Relaxing
1687,LA Affie,"The LA Affie Strain, also known as “Affi,” has a sweet but strong flavor that reacts and makes you feel the effects of the strain quickly. The LA Affie Strain is known to be very effective for making you feel better when you have headaches. It is also especially effective for treating anxiety and nausea. The LA Affie Strain is also good for getting rid of insomnia as it presses down on the most stressed parts of the human brain and relaxes it. This allows the person to sleep without facing any kind of disturbance prior to sleeping or during sleep. The LA Affie Strain is also particularly helpful in alleviating many kinds of pain from the different parts of the human body. It also gives the person an energetic kick depending on the type of person inhaling the strain. The Strain is known popularly as a psychedelic. It is a 100% indicia strain, which can be easily grown in a matter of 8 to 9 weeks since that is the time it requires to flower itself.

1688,White Siberian,"The CBD content in this White Widow offspring is high, though the exact quantities are unclear. The THC content is also relatively high for a strain with a strong dose of CBD, probably about 15%. With a sativa/indica ratio of 25:75, this hybrid delivers a subdued effect felt mostly in the body. Among its other uses, White Siberian is a strong appetite booster, so patients with wasting disorders may find it particularly useful. The high is mostly relaxed, with a dose of happiness. Users may find themselves gabbing more than usual while high on this strain. The taste and smell are earthy and woody, with a subtle flowery aroma. White Siberian is a cross between the notorious AK-47 and White Widow, though it doesn't provide the potency of either of those strains. White Siberian is best for use with depression and chronic pain, as well as ADHD and GI problems. Anxiety and paranoia are the most likely side effects. This strain is a regional rarity found mostly in Arizona, so try it if you can find it.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,75% Indica,25% Sativa,15.0,Earthy Sweet Menthol Spicy Sour Pine Herbal Mint Woody,Body High Creative Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing Sleepy Body High Creative Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing Sleepy

The spicy beef jerky aroma of this strain compliments its spicy Afghan flavor. The strain has a smooth, rich and delicious nag champa taste blended with vanilla sweetness and leaves a turpentine aftertaste. The strain sinks in immediately and the buzz lasts for up to 6 hours. A few tokes of this heavenly strain have a calming effect on sore muscles and joints and offer a pleasant relief from physical and mental stress. An ideal getaway from a hectic and monotonous schedule, this strain ensures that you get the pleasant cerebral high you deserve.

1691,PsychOG,"PsychOG certainly sounds like a potent medical choice. But while THC levels allegedly top 23% in some tests, it's not clear how reliable those numbers are. Still, this hybrid mix of Fire OG and Headband delivers heavy indica body effects thanks to its sativa/indica ratio of roughly 30:70. The high includes a pleasing physical buzz, a strong helping of euphoria, and deep-body relaxation. It's a great way to deal with low mood, migraines and other headaches, and insomnia. PsychOG isn't recommended as exclusive treatment for seizure disorders, however, since it's not known for its CBD content; the same goes for other conditions that respond to that cannabinoid. Expect a pungent, earthy aroma and a somewhat similar flavor. The buds contain a healthy layer of trichome crystals. Reports of negative side effects are hard to come by, but they probably include dry mouth and red eyes, as those are common to most strains. PsychOG is certainly a popular selection among the patients who have tried it, but it's far from widespread.

1692,Elvis OG,"This 'princely' strain originates from the powerful 'AK-47' breed when it is mixed with 'Skunk#1'. The originating two, in this case, are the powerhouses of the world of medicinal cannabis. The sativa dominance existing in this strain accounts for 70 to 90%, with a sativa – indica ratio of 75:25. The THC level has been recorded as 16% on average. This strain has a hard-hitting reaction once it enters the body, therefore it is advised that only people with really high tolerance should make use of this strain. Elvis OG has a simultaneous approach in order to counter the health issues in patients. It mellows out a patient so that their anxiety dies down, while providing a strong dose of energy which elevates creativity in the patient's brain. It is also capable of fighting chronic pain and getting rid of severe migraines. However, it may have an adverse reaction in patients with low tolerance. These side effects are felt as hallucinations and dizziness, making it unsuitable for some. The earthy taste of 'Skunk#1' combines with the sweetness of 'AK-47' leaving a complex taste on the tongue and a sweet aroma.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,16.0,Earthy Sweet Floral Spicy Herbal Skunky Pungent,Happy Relaxing Uplifting Happy Relaxing Uplifting

It is 80:20 Sativa/Indica and the THC level is about 15%. While that is on the low side compared to many of the cannabis strains offered today, not everyone is looking for a powerful high. The smell of Ole 47 is Earthy and fruity. The taste is very smooth and fruity and offers a warm feeling in the throat as it is smoked. The high takes place quickly and can last for a couple of hours. The Ole 47 plants offer very large leaves that create a decent amount of crystals for harvest. These plants grow very tall. The use of this marijuana has been often to help a person focus and to be more creative as well as alert. It can also be used to reduced inflammation and mild pain.

1695,Platinum Trainwreck,"The cerebral high from this sativa-heavy hybrid (sativa/indica ration unknown) is energized and euphoric, with sharp mental focus and clear thinking. Nobody seems to know how Platinum Trainwreck – aka Platinum Wreck – came to be, but it's reputed to be quite strong. Available THC numbers are no higher than 16%, but reliable figures are scarce, so this strain could be substantially more potent than that. CBD makes up no more than 1% of Platinum Trainwreck, which means the strain isn't a good bet for treating conditions that require CBD preparations. But the alleged THC content makes this a great choice for treating anxiety, depression, ADHD, and chronic pain. The smell has sweet and sour notes of apple and lemon, while the flavor has similar hints of apple. The appearance of the bud reflects the name, with light green leaves, amber hairs, and a silver sheen of resinous trichomes. Platinum Trainwreck has few widely reported adverse effects, but patients should expect the usual: dry mouth, dry eyes, and possible paranoia.

1696,Platinum 44,"Platinum 44 is an indica dominant hybrid strain with unknown genetics due to its rarity on the medicinal market. Although its parentage is unknown, Platinum 44 has been measured at having an average THC level of 18% on average and a low average CBD level of approximately 0.24%. This bud gets its name from its bright silvery color that comes from a thick coating of sparkling crystal trichomes. The nugs are round and dense in nature with a dark green coloration and purple undertones that are exposed once the nugs are broken apart. This bud has an intense flavor of sweet earthy flavors accented by spicy pungency. The aroma is of rich fruity earthy flavors that are accented by herbs and spices. The Platinum 44 high is very body heavy in nature due to its indica dominance. It starts with a mild euphoric effect that leaves you uplifted yet incredibly calm. This is accompanied by a slowly building numbing body buzz that immediately erases any physical or mental pain, leaving you utterly relaxed and at ease. These effects make Platinum 44 ideal for use at night by patients who suffer from conditions such as insomnia, chronic stress or anxiety, migraines or headaches, and chronic pain.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,18.0,Earthy Sweet Spicy Herbal Fruity,Body High Euphoria Relaxing Uplifting Body High Euphoria Relaxing Uplifting

1699,Cascade Delight,"This organic cut of Portland Dogshit is nothing if not hard to find. It may be available in a handful of legal dispensaries, but it's unusual even there. Portland Dogshit is itself a rarity, and not much is known about it or its descendant. But Cascade Delight is known to be an indica-dominant hybrid. The exact ratio of indica to sativa is unclear, as are the specifics of THC and CBD content. But the aroma and taste are a clear gift from the Dogshit parent plant, with a skunky flavor and a sweet, earthy smell. There are also hints of musk and pine. The indica body buzz is quite calming, an effective antidote for low mood and stress. Cascade Delight can be an effective treatment for anxiety, depression, mood disorders, and chronic pain. Side effects are limited, but as always, dry mouth and bloodshot eyes are possible. Like its parent, this strain is a native of the Pacific Northwest. Presumably that's the easiest place to find, especially in Oregon.

1700,Webster,"Webster contains about 70 percent Sativa and 30 percent Indica, making it strong Sativa dominant hybrid cannabis. Its buds are leafy with a deep green and rust colour. Due to the dominance of the Sativa variety, this marijuana strain produces a powerful Sativa high on your system that lingers for quite some time. It has a high potency due to its moderate to high THC level. Webster energizes your body and completely relaxes your mind. It can also make you fall asleep at times. The flavour of this strain is quite strong and pungent. It is a blend of hash, woody, pine and different sweet flavours. It has a very refreshing aroma that instantly energizes you. The aroma is a mixture of fresh citrus and pine scents. Webster is a perfect fit for anxiety patients who do not find relief from any other marijuana cannabis. It soothes away all the various annoying symptoms of stress such as headaches, jitteriness and depression. In addition to being used for curing stress, you can also use it as an effective antidote for fatigue as it calms down your body and mind.

1701,Purple Lightning,"Purple Lightning apparently refers to two different strains, one a modest sativa-dominant strain and the other a potent hybrid with unknown sativa/indica ratio that resulted from a cross of Trainwreck and OG Kush. The first is probably the more popular, if only because the second Purple Lightning – our version – is hard to find. THC levels are unclear, and the same is true of CBD concentrations. But the strain's appearance and lineage suggests it's quite strong. The bud is light green with strands of purple and a heavy layer of resin-soaked trichomes. The aroma is musky, with tones of lemon, pine needles, and spices, while the flavor is similar. The sativa-dominant genes of this version of Purple Lightning provide a strong cerebral punch with powerful euphoria and an energy boost. These traits make this strain perfect for treatment of depression, anxiety, physical fatigue, mood disorders, and nerve pain. Cottonmouth is the only widely reported adverse effect, though red eyes or paranoia may also occur. The other Purple Lightning is fairly easy to find, while this one is a rarity. Look on the West Coast first, but don't expect to succeed anytime soon.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,13.0,Spicy Lemon Pine,Cerebral Energizing Euphoria Cerebral Energizing Euphoria
1702,Halo OG,"Some sources claim this super-strain hits THC levels of 28% or more, though those claims are doubtful. In any event, Halo OG is definitely one of the strongest strains on the planet. The CBD content is low however, less than 1%. Halo OG is a cross of Tahoe OG and Larry OG. It's an indica-dominant strain, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica is unclear. Despite its potency, this strain is relatively hard to come by.

1704,Master Skunk,"The name of the Master Skunk Strain might put you off, but do not think for a second that this strain is anything but effective and good for you. This Master Skunk Strain has been made by Mr. Nice Seeds and is an indica dominant strain. The Master Skunk Strain is a hybrid, which is a cross between the Skunk # 1 and the Master Kush. Despite the kind of name it has, the Master Skunk Strain has a very sweet and earthy smell, which is why you should not be fooled by the name that has been attributed to it in any way. It is famous for giving a relaxing sensation to the human body and the human mind when the person makes use of it.

1706,Tiny Bomb,"Tiny Bomb, also known as ""The Incredible Tiny Bomb"" to some members of the cannabis community, is an extremely rare sativa dominant hybrid (70% sativa/30% indica) strain that is a reworked phenotype of the insanely popular Space Queen strain. This dank bud was created by breeders at TGA Genetics and boasts an average THC level ranging from 14-23%. The Tiny Bomb has a distinct aroma of sour pungent fruit and a taste that has been described as extremely sour fruity candies that have gone bad. This bud has thick airy popcorn-shaped minty green nugs with purple undertones, orange hairs, and a thin layer of trichomes and resin. Users describe the Tiny Bomb high as one that slowly creeps up on you, leaving you slightly upbeat and increasingly motivated and happy. You'll feel a fast-onset of gratifying pain relief in both mind and body followed by an intense rush of energy and motivation that peaks after about an hour or so. Upon the comedown, you'll feel lethargic and lazy with slight tendencies towards couch-lock and the munchies. Due to these potent indica and sativa effects, Tiny Bomb is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as fatigue, pain, stress, and anxiety disorders.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,30% Indica,70% Sativa,18.5,Diesel Candy Sour Fruity Pungent,Energizing Euphoria Motivation Energizing Euphoria Motivation
1707,Kid,"The exact origins of this strain are unclear. It's not even entirely clear whether Kid leans toward sativa or indica. Its effects suggest it's a sativa-dominant hybrid, but exact ratios are unknown. THC levels are also uncertain, as are CBD concentrations. But this medical strain is recommended more for its THC content than its CBD percentages. It can be helpful in treating depression, mood disorders, irritability, anxiety, and daily stresses. The cerebral high is strongly energized, with a social boost and a healthy dose of introspective thinking. Kid has a distinctly earthy flavor, and it smells of hash and pine needles. The bud is dark green in appearance, with dark brown strands and a thin layer of trichomes. Negative effects are not widely reported, since this is a decidedly rare strain, but dry mouth is likely with most strains, and red eyes may also be possible. This strain isn't widely known outside breeder circles, but it's probably most common on the West Coast. Even there, few if any dispensaries advertise or sell it.

1708,Red Raspberry Cough,"This mild, sweet sativa-dominant hybrid is nothing if not a rarity. Patients would be hard-pressed to find it anywhere, though it might appear on legal markets in the American West. It's similar in name to Strawberry Cough and other strains that cause fits of coughing, but that's about all they have in common. No one seems to know the parentage of Red Raspberry Cough, but presumably Raspberry Cough, also a sativa-dominant hybrid, was one of the parents. Don't look too hard for sources on this strain's THC or CBD content or, for that matter, its sativa/indica makeup; you won't find any. But we know the high is cerebral, with a mood boost, calming effects, and mental relief. It's a good choice in treating chronic pain, everyday stress, and anxiety. The euphoria and happiness also suggest it could help with depression and mood disorders. The flavor and smell of Red Raspberry Cough are decidedly sweet, with expected notes of raspberry, while the appearance is light green with amber strands and a light haze of trichomes on the surface. Adverse effects probably include bloodshot eyes and dry mouth, as is the case with most marijuana.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Sweet,Happy Relaxing Happy Relaxing

1711,Buddha Tahoe,"This medical marijuana strain, which is otherwise called as 'Buddha Tahoe Kush' was created by backcrossing OG Kush Tahoe cut, which is a forcibly growing strain. This is sometimes referred to as 'Tahoe OG (Reversed)'. Buddha Tahoe was first created by the breeding company, 'Big Buddha seeds'. This is another indica dominant strain that can be grown in both indoor and outdoor settings. The phenotypic characteristics of this strain are more or less like that of other indica strains. This was able to achieve the third place in the 'Cannabis Cup'. This was also ended up with the third spot in the overall competition as well. The plant is found to have an exceptional growth rate and the buds are found to be highly potent. The flavor that is being offered by this particular strain will be lemony in nature. Similar to the smell, the taste is also like a sublime lemon combined with an acute hash taste that is typical to Kush varieties. The strain is used for treating inflammation, multiple sclerosis and eating disorders. Buddha Tahoe is also found to be beneficial for the patients undertaking chemotherapy.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Citrus Kush Pungent Dank Lemon Pine,Euphoria Happy Relaxing Uplifting Euphoria Happy Relaxing Uplifting
1712,Purple African,"In Africa, sativas vastly outnumber indica strains. But it's possible this rare indica-dominant hybrid descends from unknown indica parents on that continent; the truth isn't widely known. Neither is the exact ratio of sativa to indica in Purple African. THC levels likely vary considerably between crops and batches, but the few available test results peg the contents as roughly 10%. That's enough to get high, but only barely. CBD concentrations are also low, less than 1%, which means this isn't the best strain for treating seizure disorders. But it's very helpful in treating other conditions, including pain, inflammation, nausea, and insomnia. The high is calming and sleep inducing, with modest physical relaxation and pain relief. Purple African has an earthy, skunky smell and a similar taste. The frosted green-and-brown buds, covered in shimmering trichomes, belies this strain's relatively low potency. Negatives probably include dry eyes and cottonmouth, as well as possible paranoia, but there isn't much information on the subject. California is probably the most likely place to find this pleasant choice, though it may also sell elsewhere on the West Coast. It definitely isn't popular, though.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,10.0,Earthy Skunky,Relaxing Relaxing
1713,Rishi Kush,"Rishi Kush is a mild medical option for patients suffering from anxiety, glaucoma, and everyday stress. It's ideal for patients and recreational users who are new to marijuana or otherwise have low tolerance. THC levels vary between 11% and slightly more than 17%, but tend to be on the low end of that range. This strain's parents come from the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan and the cannabis fields of North India, though the specific strains are unclear. It's said to be an even hybrid, with a sativa/indica ratio of roughly 50:50, and that balance shows in the modest high, which is both physically calming and mentally focused. Reported CBD levels are very low in Rishi Kush, meaning it isn't recommended as primary treatment for seizures or other health problems that respond to that chemical. With a sweet, fruity lemon smell, this strain produces leafy green buds with light brown hairs. Negative effects likely include cottonmouth and dry eyes, though there isn't much public information on the subject.

Even in those places, though, this is not an easy strain to find. Dispensaries are increasingly selling strains high in CBD, so Beaver Dawg might gradually become more common in coming years. THC levels are low, less than 2% in some tests, while CBD levels top at least 4%, making this strain ideal for treating pediatric epilepsy and some other childhood illnesses. Some sources say Beaver Dawg is sativa-dominant, other that it's indica-dominant. But it delivers a calming, energized body buzz that suggests it's more indica than sativa (exact ratio unknown).

In fact, it is a kind that will deeply relax your body and mind, so much so that you might actually spend the evening in bed, beating insomnia. The strain is derived from motivation cannabis seeds which have an ancestry with Warlock and Sensi Star. Motivation marijuana belongs to the family of various Indica strains and offers a high potency dose which has the ability to knock any smoker's socks off.

1990,Charlie OG Kush,"Despite the name, Charlie OG Kush isn’t really a “kush” strain. Rather, it’s a sativa dominant hybrid (80% sativa/20% indica) strain with unknown parentage due to breeder secrecy. However, it is thought to be a cross of Chemdawg and Hindu Kush, perhaps with a hint of Lemon Thai. Regardless, Charlie OG Kush has set the genetic foundation for many strains in the Western region of the United States. No matter its parentage, the Charlie OG Kush high is definitely an uplifting eye-opening experience. You’ll feel euphoric and relaxed as your mental and physical pain simply melt away with a buzzing calming effect. Your body will slowly be overcome by a sedative body high as your mind begins to soar with clear-headed effects. As you continue to smoke, you may start to experience psychedelic effects, especially if you are a novice user. These effects coupled with a moderately high THC level make Charlie OG Kush perfect for treating patients suffering from conditions such as migraines, chronic anxiety or stress, mild to moderate cases of depression, digestion issues, and more. This bud has small rounded bright minty green nugs with lots of fiery orange hairs and a thick coating of crystal chunky amber trichomes.

1992,Cannalope AK,"The sativa genes win out in this rare medical selection (sativa/indica ratio of about 30:70), promising a heady high that may be helpful in alleviating the symptoms of patients suffering from anxiety, depression, or mood disorders. Beyond that, there isn't much public data on this strain or its potential medical uses. There also isn't much specific information on the type of high created by Cannalope AK, or on how much THC or CBD is contained in the strain. But Cannalope AK descends from two potent sativa-dominant hybrids, Cannalope and AK-47, so the experience is likely head-focused with some physical relaxation provided by the indica genes. Cannalope and AK-47 are both widely popular and typically very powerful. Hybrids don't always capture the potency of their parent plants, but if Cannalope AK is as at least as strong as they are, it should make for a strong choice with THC levels potentially exceeding 20%. There's little if any information on the taste and smell of this strain, or on its appearance. This strain might be found on some American legal markets, but it certainly isn't common. It may be somewhat easier to find on the black market.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,70% Indica,30% Sativa,20.0,Tropical Sweet,Euphoria Happy Relaxing Euphoria Happy Relaxing
1993,Snowdizzle,"This highly rated strain is a product of Pre-98 Bubba Kush and Snowdawg 2, both indicas. Snowdizzle is also predominantly indica (sativa/indica ratio of 25:75), a fact reflected in the body high it produces. There isn't an extraordinary amount of THC in this strain, though exact amounts are hard to come by. CBD contents are unknown, but this strain isn't the best choice for alleviating symptoms that respond to that cannabinoid. The flavor is sweet, delicate, and pleasing. Snowdizzle tastes and smells of coffee, lemon, and strawberry. The body buzz is also quite pleasing, with deep relaxation and calming effects. Beyond that, not much is known about how this strain affects users. It's recommended as an effective treatment for migraine headaches, nausea, pain, and insomnia. Snowdizzle is best reserved for late at night because of its sedating effects. There are few public reports of negatives when smoking this strain, though dry mouth is probably the most likely. Finding Snowdizzle could prove to be a formidable task, as it isn't widely available.

1994,Alakazam,"Alakazam is an evenly balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain created by breeders at the infamous Seed Makers. This rare strain has unknown genetics, as its creators keep it hidden from the cannabis community and boasts a THC level ranging from 18-20% on average. Alakazam is well-known for its appearance: it has dark olive green and rich purple buds with long furry deep purple hairs. These nugs are dense, dripping with sweet sticky resin, and covered in a thick layer of fine white trichomes. Alakazam has an aroma that is of warm melted buttery sugar and a taste of smooth caramel that sweetens as you exhale. This dank strain offers the user an immediate cerebral head high that leaves them euphoric and with significant mind relief.

1995,Blue Northern,"Blue Northern may sound more like a freight railroad than a marijuana strain, but it's a crossbreed of two beloved, extremely potent indicas: Blueberry, which has THC levels that can reach 24%, and Northern Lights, which has a top THC concentration of 26%. Like its ancestors, Blue Northern is dominated by indica genes (sativa/indica ratio of 30:70), but not much is known about its THC or CBD levels. Still, it's likely quite strong, given its parentage. This strain has a distinct berry flavor and an aroma of strawberries. A few quick puffs lead to deep body relaxation, with a dreamy euphoria and limited cerebral effects. Save this strain for late at night, as it's ideal for treating insomnia or putting a troubling day in the past. Blue Northern can effectively treat both pain and sleeplessness, while some users may also find relief for anxiety or other mental health disorders. As for side effects, dry mouth and bloodshot eyes are probably the most common, though there are few reports of any kind about this strain.

1996,Cheddar Head,"Cheese on the head usually summons images of Wisconsin football fans. This strain probably isn't very popular there, though. In fact, it's not terribly popular anywhere. It's likely easiest to find on the West Coast or in Colorado, but even there it isn't common. With THC levels that can reach 20%, this is a relatively strong sativa-dominant hybrid (70:30 sativa/indica hybrid). CBD levels are low, though just how low isn't clear. There's another strain by the same name, though that is a pure sativa with lower THC and CBD levels. Cheddar Head is ideal for treating depression and chronic pain, as well as anxiety. The high is relaxed but stimulating, with a boost of energy. Despite its name, this strain doesn't taste or smell like cheddar cheese. Rather it has a sugary sweet aroma and a fruity candy flavor with hints of berries. Cheddar Head is a crossbreed of Exodus Cheese and Snowdawg 2. Its popularity is limited, though it's probably easiest to find on the West Coast and in Colorado.

1998,Dess*tar,"Dess*tar, aka Desstar, is a sativa-dominant hybrid that descends from Star Ship and Kali Mist. THC levels are unknown, as are CBD levels, but this is a fairly potent strain with energizing effects. The exact ratio of sativa to indica is unknown, but Kali Mist is nearly 100% sativa and Star Ship is an indica-dominant hybrid. Desstar may be helpful with anxiety and depression, though its exact medical uses are largely unknown. It's not a very popular strain, so it would be hard to find almost anywhere outside the American West. And it's scarce even there. But the calming, mildly psychedelic mental high encourages focus and relaxation and may also spark creativity. This strain smells like a combination of hash and pineapple. The flavor is fruity, with haze and caramel tones. Desstar probably isn't a great choice for most medical conditions, at least until more is known about its effects. Dry mouth is probably the most likely negative effect, with other effects possible.

It is sweet, earthy with citrus undertones. However, it leaves a rich citrus aftertaste that lingers in the mouth which is a treat for almost any cannabis user. Even though the strain looks like a creeper, it offers a hard hitting high that kicks in a matter of minutes. You will feel euphoric and happy but smoking too much of the strain can cause you to exhibit couch-lock symptoms. The strain is better off being smoked in the evening due to its body numbing effects. On the other hand, it has several medical applications and can be used to treat depression, stress and chronic pains and aches as well.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,70% Indica,30% Sativa,22.0,Earthy Citrus Blueberry Sweet Pungent Spicy Herbal Berry Pine,Creative Happy Hungry Relaxing Creative Happy Hungry Relaxing
2024,Sweet Blue,"There are rare marijuana strains and then there are strains so rare you can't say much of anything about them with any certainty. Sweet Blue is one of those strains, a truly hard-to-find medical choice that combines an unclear sativa heredity with unknown indica genes (sativa/indica ratio not widely available). There are so few public reports about this strain that it's impossible to gauge its THC or CBD content. That means it's also impossible to say with any confidence what medical conditions can be treated with Sweet Blue, though the lack of details suggests it's a poor choice as front-line treatment for seizures or other problems that respond to CBD. It's also hard to make even an educated guess about what kind of effects users can expect to experience – physical or cerebral, mild or strong, quick or long lasting. There is likewise no public data on the taste, smell, or appearance of Sweet Blue. And its parentage is yet another mystery. So is the availability of this strain: It may exist in the American West, but it's probably mostly found in the backyards of a handful of amateur growers.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,13.0,Earthy Berry Dank Sweet,Euphoria Happy Relaxing Uplifting Euphoria Happy Relaxing Uplifting

2044,The Bob,"No, not Bob Marley. This complex sativa-heavy hybrid, which has a sativa/indica ratio of at least 70:30, was created in homage to the great comedic genius Bob Saget of ""Full House"" legend. It's a combination of Ft. Collins (aka FoCo), S.A.G.E. (itself a mix of Big Sur Holy and an Afghani), and finally Hanis (a purple Kunduz Afghani joined with Pre-'98 Bubba Kush and 1994 Positronics Haze). All those crossbred genes make for a powerful head high with psychoactive effects and a strong, unique mood boost. The Bob is reputedly quite potent, but it's hard to find any solid numbers to back that claim. Still, it's definitely popular among those who have tried it. CBD numbers are likewise scarce, meaning this strain isn't recommended as treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that require CBD preparations. The Bob has a dank, chemical flavor with hints of chocolate and a sweet, chemical smell. The buds are plump and frosted, with a purple, mint-green appearance. Negative effects haven't been widely reported, but red eyes and cottonmouth are safe bets.

The high is distinctly psychedelic, a combination of body buzz and soaring, euphoric cerebral effects that derive mostly from the dominant sativa genes. Ultra Lemon Haze produces a spectacular smoke that tastes and smells of tart lemons and citrus fruit, with strong chemical hints of diesel fuel. This strain is certainly popular among those patients who have tried it, but they're relatively few and far between. Ultra Lemon Haze sells mostly on the legal medical marijuana market in Washington State, though it occasionally appears in other parts of the United States.

P-91 is best for the medical patients of chronic pain as it helps in alleviating almost all types of severe pains, including excruciating backache. It can also be employed for finding relief from insomnia. Nausea, loss of appetite and anxiety can also be mitigated by smoking P-91. It is a safe strain, but tends to result in incredibly dry mouth and sometimes dry eyes.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,22.0,Earthy Citrus Chemical Sweet Spicy Fruity Lemon Pine Woody,Creative Euphoria Focus Happy Mellow Relaxing Uplifting Creative Euphoria Focus Happy Mellow Relaxing Uplifting
2743,Pineapple Thai,"Pineapple Thai is an extremely rare 100% pure sativa strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy. This dank bud boasts a potent average THC level that ranges from 20-24% and an insanely high CBD level that ranges from 4-5% on average. Pineapple Thai is best known for its aroma of sweet tropical pineapple and its taste of sweet tropical pineapple that becomes spicy upon exhale. These buds have small to medium-sized fluffy neon green nugs with rich gold undertones and fiery orange hairs. These nugs are dusted with a fine layer of sandy white trichomes and sweet sticky resin. Users describe the Pineapple Thai high as the perfect wake-and-bake strain due to its immediate uplifting cerebral head high effects that leave you completely pain-free with growing waves of euphoric motivated energy. These effects are long-lasting and keep you alert and focused, with hints of psychedelic effects if too much is consumed at once. Due to these potent combined THC and CBD effects, Pineapple Thai is said to be an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic pain due to injury or illness, chronic stress or anxiety, and sleep-related disorders, including insomnia and chronic fatigue.",Sativa,,,22.0,Earthy Sweet Pineapple Spicy Tropical Herbal Fruity,Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Sociable Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Sociable

2745,Pure Afghan,"As its name suggests, Pure Afghan is a pure indica landrace out of the Kush Mountains in Afghanistan (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100). It's relatively rare outside of that country, though it can be found on the legal markets of Amsterdam and the American Pacific Northwest. It's a mellow medical choice that can be used to treat anxiety, low mood, migraines and other headaches, lack of appetite, ADHD, inflammation, and chronic pain, as well as insomnia. The effects are calming and happy, with creativity, mental focus, and powerful hunger. THC levels aren't terribly impressive, measuring roughly 12% in publicly available tests. That means Pure Afghan may be a good choice for patients who rarely toke. It's not a good choice for people who suffer from conditions that can be treated with CBD, such as epilepsy, because that chemical is scarce in this strain. Expect an earthy, floral scent with hints of pine, and a similar flavor. Pure Afghan produces large, green, leafy buds with brown hairs. Dry mouth and paranoia appear to be the most common negative effects, but limited dry eyes and dizziness are also reported. This strain can be found in medical marijuana dispensaries between Eugene, Ore., and Vancouver, British Columbia.",Indica,,,12.0,Earthy Sweet Spicy Pine Mint Woody,Creative Focus Happy Hungry Relaxing Sleepy Creative Focus Happy Hungry Relaxing Sleepy
2746,Purple AK-47,"This strain is an indica-heavy cross of Granddaddy Purps and AK-47, though its exact sativa/indica ratio isn't widely known. Despite the indica dominance, Purple AK-47 delivers a complex combination of head and body effects: physical relaxation, sleepiness, happiness, euphoria, and an intense tingly sensation. It has many medical uses, including treatment for anxiety, depression, eye pressure, headaches, inflammation, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. Purple AK-47 contains no more as much as 18% THC, making it a relatively potent choice for medical or recreational users. CBD levels, on the other hand, are less than 2%, so this strain isn't an ideal tool in treating seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to that chemical. The smell and flavor of Purple AK-47 have sweet notes of honey, pine trees, and plums, while the nugs are bright green and purple with brown hairs and a layer of crystals. The most commonly reported side effects are dry mouth, red eyes, dizziness, and limited paranoia. This strain sells mostly in California, Michigan, and Oregon, though it can also sometimes be found on the black market.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Earthy Citrus Sweet Pungent Grape Fruity Berry Pine Woody,Energizing Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sociable Energizing Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sociable

2748,Purple Sage,"Though often pegged as an even hybrid, Purple Sage in fact appears to have a sativa/indica ratio of roughly 35:65. It's believed to be a descendant of SAGE and an unknown purps mix. The high hits both head and body, mixing creativity, euphoria, mental focus, happiness, and drowsiness. Though THC levels are somewhat modest, reaching 16% in publicly available tests, Purple Sage is a pleasant choice for part-time tokers and other users with low tolerance. It can be used to treat depression, anxiety, nausea, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. But the available information suggests CBD levels are very low, less than 1%, which means Purple Sage isn't the best choice for treating conditions that are relieved with that chemical, such as severe epileptic disorders. Sweet notes of sage and lemon dominate the smell and flavor of this strain, while the buds are light green with brown hairs. The only widely reported adverse effects are dry mouth and dry eyes, though others may be possible. Purple Sage is popular enough among those who have tried it, but it definitely isn't widespread. Colorado is probably the best place to look for it.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,65% Indica,35% Sativa,20.0,Sweet Citrus Chemical Lemon Sage,Aroused Creative Euphoria Focus Happy Sleepy Aroused Creative Euphoria Focus Happy Sleepy
2749,PVC OG,"This indica-dominant strain (sativa/indica ration unknown) is almost certainly a descendant of the original OG Kush, but beyond that not much is known about its heredity. PVC OG is the private creation of Positive Vibrations Collective in Long Beach, Cal., and that's about the only place on Earth where patients are likely to find it. The amount of THC and CBD in this strain is something of a mystery, though published reviews suggest it's relatively potent with THC. The paucity of information about CBD contents means this strain probably shouldn't be relied upon as exclusive treatment for seizure conditions. Instead, PVC is good medication for anxiety, ADHD, muscle spasms, chronic pain, and everyday stress. The high is mostly physical, with mental clarity, a dose of euphoria, and a tingly sensation throughout the body. This strain has an earthy, floral smell and a similar taste. The buds are purple and green with orange hairs and dense crystals. There are few reports of adverse effects, but users can probably expect watery eyes, cottonmouth, and possibly paranoia. PVC OG is worth trying if only for its subtle take on OG Kush, but unless you live near Los Angeles, you'll have to go looking for it.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Earthy Floral,Euphoria Focus Euphoria Focus
2750,Q3,"Q3 is a rare sativa-dominant strain, though the precise ratio of sativa to indica genes isn't widely known. It's an ideal daytime selection, delivering a powerful cerebral high that comes with a boost of creativity, euphoria, giggling, happiness, and increased sociability. This strain's THC levels enhance those effects, bringing potency as strong as 21% in some tests. With numbers like that, Q3 is an effective medication for treating depression, chronic pain, insomnia, and everyday stress. But the amount of CBD found in this plant is much lower, much too low to recommend it for treatment of seizures and other conditions that can be alleviated with CBD concentrates. The smell and flavor of Q3 are both fruity with hints of lemon, while the small nugs are light green with numerous orange hairs and a dense layer of frosty trichome crystals. The only widely reported negative effects from this strain are dry eyes and dry mouth, though others may be possible. Q3 is far from popular, despite the substantial punch it packs, but it may be found in at least one Denver medical marijuana dispensary.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,21.0,Grapefruit Citrus Fruity Apple Lemon,Creative Euphoria Focus Giggly Happy Hungry Sociable Creative Euphoria Focus Giggly Happy Hungry Sociable
2751,Purple Hashplant,"Purple Hashplant is an evenly-balanced hybrid with a combination of cerebral and body effects (it has a sativa/indica ratio of roughly 50:50). The high is hungry and creative yet lazy and calming, euphoric and giggly yet sleepy at the same time. That makes this a solid choice for medicating sleep disorders, lack of appetite, anxiety, migraine headaches, chronic pain, and stress. But it's not such a good selection for patients who suffer from severe seizure disorders or other maladies that require CBD, as the concentration of that chemical is very low, judging by the lack of publicly available test results. THC levels are also hard to determine, yet there is no reason to think Purple Hashplant is either especially potent or especially weak. It produces a fruity berry aroma and a similar taste, while the buds are dark green and purple with orange hairs. Adverse effects include dry eyes and dry mouth, but other negatives appear to be less likely. Though Purple Hashplant has its fans, it isn't particularly popular anywhere; still, it might be found at medical marijuana dispensaries in California's Inland Empire.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Sweet Grape Fruity Berry Skunky,Aroused Euphoria Giggly Happy Relaxing Aroused Euphoria Giggly Happy Relaxing
2752,Red Dwarf,"Red Dwarf is an extremely rare 100% pure indica strain created by breeders at the infamous Buddha Seeds farms as a dank cross between a White Dwarf phenotype X Ruderalis. This strain is not usually bred due to its low THC content, which ranges from 7-15% on average, but is rather grown for its ability to reach adulthood within a 6-week span. Due to its small size, Red Dwarf is an ideal strain for indoor breeders to grow who don't have very much room to spare. This bud smokes like an indica, leaving you feeling instantly sedated and at ease with mild couch-lock that won't completely knock you out. You'll feel relaxed yet spacey and easily distracted with a mellow case of the munchies. Due to these potent indica effects, Red Dwarf is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic migraines and tension headaches, chronic pain due to injury or illness, and appetite loss. Red Dwarf has dense arrowhead-shaped light minty green nugs with rich amber hairs and undertones and dark olive green leaves. These nugs are hairy and caked in milky white trichomes. These nugs have an aroma of skunky floral coffee and a taste of rich floral java with a skunky exhale.",Indica,,,11.0,Skunky Sweet Woody,Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sleepy Sociable Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sleepy Sociable
2753,Redding OG,"Redding OG was awarded the third prize at the Los Angeles Cannabis Cup in 2014. It is a hybrid strain that comprises of bright orange hairs that shoot wildly from the pure white coating of the frosty crystals. Together, these features provide Redding OG with a pale insipid green color. Redding OG is a potency and very long lasting marijuana strain that provides enough energy for social gatherings but only if consumed in high doses. This marijuana strain has the capability to be the finale of your day. With a high THC content, Redding OG is predominantly effective in warding off appetite loss, sleeplessness, stress and depression. This is a hard-hitting sativa hybrid and a joint of 1 gram lasts for almost eight hours. It is mostly popular for creating an entertaining social environment. Redding OG carries an initial hard hitting effect similar to that of Jack Frost. For people who enjoy sativa dominant strains, this is a must try. The buds of this strain break up well and carry a fresh and pleasant smell. It is not blatantly munchies and is a definite option for couch potatoes. Its popularity is mostly attributed towards the highly energized effects that if provides and the fact that it is socially popular.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Earthy Sweet Herbal Fruity,Energizing Euphoria Giggly Happy Hungry Relaxing Sociable Uplifting Energizing Euphoria Giggly Happy Hungry Relaxing Sociable Uplifting

2755,Rockstar Master Kush,"Don't confuse this Canadian strain with the better known Rockstar or Rockstar OG. Rockstar Master Kush is a blend of Master Kush, Sensi Star, and an Afghani indica, and is itself a strong indica (sativa/indica ratio of roughly 10:90). It's a good tool in treating tension and anxiety, a product of its calming, euphoric body high. The experience is hungry and sleepy but creative. Despite the presence of some limited sativa-like effects, this strain is best used late at night or on days with few responsibilities, as it can induce couch-lock. Use Rockstar Master Kush to treat fatigue, migraines and other headaches, inflammation, nerve pain, chronic pain, and anxiety. The flavor and aroma are a combination of earth, pine needles, and mint, while the bud has a light green appearance with brown hairs and a layer of crystals. THC levels have been measured above 15%, making this a moderately potent choice great for newcomers and occasional tokers. CBD levels are far too low to recommend Rockstar Master Kush as a treatment for seizure disorders, with test results well below 1%. This strain is mostly confined to southern British Columbia, near the border with Washington State, but may make its way to the black market on rare occasions.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,90% Indica,10% Sativa,15.0,Earthy Sweet Menthol Mint Lemon Berry Pine Woody,Creative Euphoria Giggly Hungry Relaxing Sleepy Creative Euphoria Giggly Hungry Relaxing Sleepy

2757,Root Beer Kush,"This regional specialty from the Great White North is hard to locate outside of British Columbia, but its heady, euphoric buzz may be worth the hunt. Its obscure origins and general scarcity also make it a good find for obscurity hounds. Though Root Beer Kush is mostly sativa, there is little available data on the exact ratio of sativa to indica in this plant. It's also hard to come by any details on cannabinoid levels, including both THC and CBD. Reports and reviews suggest the THC levels are relatively high, which means a calming but creative cerebral experience that includes a dose of euphoria, focused mental relief, and a tingling sensation. CBD, on the other hand, is not reported in large numbers, meaning this strain probably shouldn't be used as the only source of treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that require CBD. But Root Beer Kush is known to be an effective treatment for anxiety, depression, migraines and other headaches, nausea, insomnia, and everyday stress. Dry eyes and cottonmouth are the only widely reported negative side effects. The flavor and aroma of Root Beer Kush are earthy with sweet notes of orange, strawberry, and vanilla.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Orange Earthy Sweet Spicy Herbal Fruity Strawberry Vanilla,Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Relaxing Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Relaxing
2758,Sapphire Star,"This hybrid is a cross of God Bud, an indica, and Good Hawaiian, a sativa-dominant hybrid. It's easy to find – if you live in Arizona. Otherwise, you'll have a hard time getting your hands on Sapphire Star. It's sativa-dominant, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica isn't clear. Likewise, there's only limited information on THC and CBD levels, though there's little evidence to suggest either is especially high. Sapphire Star and its happy cerebral effects make for an effective way to treat anxiety, low mood, irritability, and stress. With uncertain CBD contents, though, it probably isn't a great choice for alleviating seizure disorders or other illnesses that respond to CBD. Expect a limited body buzz and clear-headed mental effects, including euphoria, focused thinking, an energy boost, and increased creativity. Sapphire Star tastes and smells of berries, with a sour, Skunky aroma and a sour flavor with hints of wood. No negative effects are widely reported, though that probably reflects this strain's rarity than its lack of side effects. This strain sells on the Arizona medical market but would be much harder to find elsewhere in America.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,24.0,Grapefruit Sweet Menthol Sour Lemon Berry Skunky Woody,Body High Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing Sociable Body High Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing Sociable
2759,Satori,"Satori is a true hybrid medical marijuana strain which is a cross between Lucid Dreams and an unidentified sativa hybrid. This strain was brought into the market by 'Mandala Seeds' in the year 2005. This sativa-indica strain is among the top ten strains in ""High Times Strain of the Year 2007"". This plant was grown as a multi-stem plant as 60% sativa dominant strain. The THC levels of this particular strain are found to be lying between 23% and 28%. The aroma that is being produced by this strain is a combination of fruity, pungency, earthy and spicy. The flowers of this plant possess a distinctive aroma that is comparable with tea and honey. This plant will have high quality buds that are featured with long trichomes. This particular strain would tend to ease our minds thereby opening the doors towards creativity. Therefore, this strain will be perfect for creative people like writers, musicians and others. The flavors of Satori might provide the users the relief from the symptoms of depression, fatigue, stress, headache and anxiety. This strain is also known for inducing appetite among the users. Furthermore, this strain could alleviate the effects of sleep disorders, nerve pain and some sensory motor disorders (for example: restless leg syndrome).",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,25.5,Earthy Mango Sweet Spicy Herbal Honey,Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy
2760,Seattle Blue,"Not surprisingly, Seattle Blue is a hometown original from the Pacific Northwest. It can still be found there, and in California, but elsewhere it definitely isn't common. The genetics and parentage of this strain are unclear, though it is known to be an intense indica (exact sativa/indica ratio unknown). That indica dominance shows through in the intense body high, which is euphoric, happy, and hungry, making this an ideal selection for patients who want to treat wasting and eating disorders. The physical buzz is also complemented by cerebral creativity and mental focus. Seattle Blue is a good choice for alleviating the symptoms of several conditions: anxiety, depression, mood disorders, migraines and other headaches, muscle spasms, chronic pain, insomnia, and everyday stresses. With THC levels that can top 20%, it's a potent medical choice. CBD levels, however, are very low, almost nonexistent. So this strain shouldn't be relied upon as the only means of treating conditions that respond to CBD. Expect a sweet, fruity smell and flavor, with hints of soil and flowers. Cottonmouth and red eyes are the most common negative effects, while paranoia and dizziness are also possible.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,20.0,Earthy Sweet Floral Fruity Lemon Strawberry Berry,Creative Euphoria Focus Happy Hungry Relaxing Creative Euphoria Focus Happy Hungry Relaxing

2762,Skydog,A Canadian hybrid strain that has taken off in many areas including the USA is Skydog. The actual parents vary but they are strong Indicas with some haze. The ratio is about 80:20 Indica/Sativa. The smell it offers is lemon and that is also the smooth taste it offers. The THC level can be up to 21%. This particular plant doesn't grow very tall but it does offer a nice yield. The buds are dark green in color and they form large clusters. The crystals that form on them are a light dusting but the intensity of them more than makes up for the lack of volume. Skydog offers a very intense high that isn't recommended for those new to the use of cannabis. Smoking it is the most common method of use. It is a dry strain so some people find it initiates coughing. It is often used by those that want a very in depth high or those that suffer from high levels of chronic pain.,Indica Dominant Hybrid,80% Indica,20% Sativa,19.5,Earthy Citrus Sweet Diesel Spicy Herbal Lemon Skunky Lime Woody Tangy,Aroused Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing Sleepy Aroused Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing Sleepy

When it comes to insanely sweet flavors, Razz Fizz is one of the best. This bud packs a sweet and fruity raspberry lemon flavor into each and every flowery little toke.

The Razz Fizz high is just as sweet, with long-lasting effects that are best suited for lazy afternoons or nights in when you don’t have much of anything to get done.

2937,Blurberry,"You read that right: Blurberry, not Blueberry. It's not clear where the former came from, exactly, but presumably it's a hybrid descendant of the latter. The indica genes are dominant, providing a sativa/indica ration of roughly 30:70 and a heavy but euphoric body buzz and a strong tingling sensation. It's recommended mostly for the treatment of chronic pain and body aches, but it may also be useful for some patients with anxiety or depression. Not much is known about how much THC Burberry contains, but there is little evidence to suggest it's especially potent. CBD data are also scarce, which means patients shouldn't rely on this strain as the only source of treatment for conditions that respond to that cannabinoid. There are notes of blueberry in the taste and smell of Blurberry, which has a harsh, grassy flavor and a sweet, fruity aroma with hints of spice. The nugs are light green with orange hairs and a layer of crystals. Side effects are always possible, but there are few specifics available on this strain. Still, expect dry mouth, dry eyes, and possibly paranoia.

The exact balance of these potent genes in Casey's Dream is unknown, but it's rumored to be a very powerful strain. THC levels are unclear, as are CBD contents, but this strain probably doesn't contain enough CBD to recommend it for seizure disorders or other medical problems that respond to CBD; few sativas do. The powerful, long lasting high is cerebral and creative, with a boost of energy and euphoria. Use it to treat depression, anxiety, physical fatigue, chronic pain, and everyday life stress. Expect a pungent chemical aroma with hints of blueberry and a chemical flavor with Haze notes. The appearance is light green with light amber strands and a dense layer of resinous trichomes.

Cate Harrington the strain is an indica-dominant hybrid with a sativa/indica ratio of no more than 30:70.

The high is heavily cerebral, creating a creative, clear-headed state with energy, strong euphoria, and improved mood. Expect typical side effects, including cottonmouth and red eyes, though there isn't much information on this front, either. In addition to grapefruit, this strain tastes and smells of grape and other fruits. Perplex nugs are blanketed in resin-rich trichomes, a hint at the effects that await. This strain doesn't come around very often, though it might be possible to find it in Colorado. Otherwise, don't put yourself out; despite its potency, it's rare almost everywhere.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,15.0,Grape Fruity,Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Happy Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Happy
3512,Phoenix Sun,"The bud of this Arizona original have a dark green appearance with strands of purple, dark blue, and amber, plus a thick coating of trichomes. The smell and flavor are subdued, almost nonexistent, but beyond that not much information is available on flavor or aroma. Phoenix Sun is a highly versatile sativa-dominant hybrid (ratio of sativa to indica unknown) useful at almost any time of day. THC and CBD concentrations aren't widely known, but this is known as a very potent strain that delivers a strong high within just three or four hits. It's not well known at all, but it definitely isn't known for its CBD contents, so it probably shouldn't be used as the sole treatment for a seizure disorder. The effects of Phoenix Sun are energized and euphoric, with mental clarity and happiness. It can be used to treat multiple health problems, such as anxiety, depression, mood disorders, fatigue, nausea, stress, and insomnia. Details on negative effects is limited, but cottonmouth and dry eyes are probably common. Obviously the best place to look for Phoenix Sun is on Arizona's medical market, but it doesn't appear to be popular anywhere else.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Earthy Sweet Floral Fruity,Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy

3514,Platinum Ghost,"This indica-heavy hybrid (sativa/indica ratio unclear) delivers a strong, distinct odor and flavor of berries and hash plant. The nugs are dark green with brown hairs and a layer of trichome crystals. Platinum Ghost is said to deliver a potent and immediate high that hits both the body and the mind. The effects are calming but energized, with couch-lock effects, euphoria, and sharp mental focus. This strain can be a useful medicine for the treatment of anxiety, low mood, chronic pain, stress, and sleeplessness. The potency of Platinum Ghost is hard to gauge, as there are few public test results available. But its reputation suggests it's relatively strong, if not remarkably so. The same lack of information on CBD levels mean patients shouldn't rely on this strain as their only treatment for conditions that require CBD concentrates, such as severe epilepsy. Reports of side effects are few and far between, but users can probably expect dry mouth and red eyes, as well as possible paranoia.

3516,Platinum King Kush,"The Platinum King Kush is bright green in color with crystals covering the buds, which make it look platinum. Orange hairs grow from this leafy strain of marijuana. Smoking the Platinum King Kush gives users a body and head buzz due to THC and CBD levels. It is indica-dominant therefore, it calms down the nerves of the user and makes them feel relaxed and stress-free. Mostly, effects are cerebral and increase the release of endorphins, which elevates and uplifts spirits. Platinum King Kush is also known to cause drowsiness and induce sleep. Platinum King Kush is used as medical marijuana to treat psychological disorders of anxiety and depression. It also reduces inflammation and cures mild headaches or migraines. This strain is effective for all kinds of physical and mental pain and is also used by insomniacs to get a good night's sleep. The strain has an earthy flavor with bursts of citrus that tantalize the taste buds of smokers with every toke. The smoke emits an aroma, which is pungent and dank but also pleasing to the nose as it has an earthy and citrusy complexity added to it as well. The THC content is at 18% while CBD makes up 0.24% of the drug.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Earthy Pungent Citrus,Body High Cerebral Euphoria Happy Relaxing Body High Cerebral Euphoria Happy Relaxing

3518,Purple Pine,"Purple Pine may simply be another name for Purple Pine Cone, but there isn't enough information available about either strain to know for sure. In any event, this strain is an indica-dominant hybrid with an unknown ratio of sativa to indica. The few available tests suggest THC levels are rather low, below 10%. Unfortunately, CBD is also low, limiting the medical usefulness of Purple Pine. It's recommended for use in treating anxiety, but that's about it. Because of the low CBD content, this strain shouldn't be used to treat seizure disorders or other health conditions that can be alleviated with that cannabinoid. The physical high, both happy and sleepy, is a result of this strain's indica-heavy genes. The flavor and smell of Purple Pine are harsh with sweet notes of berry. The buds are purple with long orange hairs. Side effects aren't widely reported, but they probably include dry eyes and dry mouth, as well as possible paranoia or anxiety. This strain is a Washington State specialty, but it can also be found on the medical marijuana market in Southern California.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,14.5,Earthy Sweet Fruity Berry Pine,Happy Relaxing Uplifting Happy Relaxing Uplifting
3519,Pure Gold,"Pure Gold is an indica-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio unknown), though it may also come in a sativa-dominant variety. It's hard to say for sure, as this modestly potent strain is rather obscure, possibly found in California but not much of anywhere else. It's unclear how much of the plant is THC and how much is CBD, but the few scattered reports on Pure Gold suggest it isn't particularly heavy with either. The lack of CBD means this strain shouldn't be used as the only tool for treating seizure disorders or other conditions that can be relieved with that chemical. Rather, Pure Gold can be used to medicate anxiety, lack of appetite, and sleeplessness. The high is physical, inducing deep relaxation, sleepiness, and couch-lock effects. This strain produces bright green buds with orange hairs and trichomes. The smell is Skunky with hints of lemon, while the flavor includes notes of lemon, vanilla, and wood. There are few public reports of adverse effects caused by Pure Gold, but it's safe to assume dry mouth, red eyes, and paranoia are among them. Found throughout California, this strain is relatively popular on the legal market, less so on the black market.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,14.0,Lemon Skunky Woody Vanilla,Relaxing Relaxing
3520,Purple Butter,"This indica strain (exact sativa/indica ratio unknown) is known to deliver a very potent body high perfect for late nights and rainy days. It also spurs a powerful case of the munchies, making Purple Butter an ideal choice for patients with eating disorders or wasting conditions. It's also recommended for treatment of headaches and chronic pain. The effects are almost entirely physical and deeply sedating, so this strain shouldn't be used on busy days or when mental focus is needed. It's hard to discern how much THC this strain contains, as tests aren't widely reported. The same is true of CBD, and that alone suggests Purple Butter shouldn't be used as the only treatment for CBD-friendly diseases, such as epilepsy. There are no reliable public reports on the side effects patients may experience when using this strain, but most other strains produce dry eyes and dry mouth. Purple Butter has a distinct berry flavor, with smooth grape notes; the aroma is similar but with additional hints of Skunk. This strain sells in San Diego but appears to be very rare almost everywhere else.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,19.0,Berry Skunky Grape,Body High Body High
3521,Purple Dynamite,"There are no public reports on the exact genetic balance of Purple Dynamite, but if its parents are any indication, it's a near-pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100). This strain was the result of a cross between Purple Kush and Dynamite, both pure indicas. The THC levels in Purple Dynamite top out at more than 22% in available tests, making this an excellent and powerful choice for treating anxiety, depression, eating disorders, wasting disorders, and physical pain. The effects are physical and deeply calming, with couch-lock effects and powerful hunger. CBD levels are minimal, however, which means Purple Dynamite is not a good medication for the treatment of epilepsy or other conditions that respond to CBD. With a sweet, tropical flavor, this strain smells of berries. It has dense, dark purple buds with a heavy frosting of resinous crystals. Patients and recreational users of this strain have reported few side effects, but they likely include watery eyes, dry mouth, and possibly paranoia. Despite its potency, Purple Dynamite isn't especially popular anywhere, though it can be found on the medical marijuana market in Massachusetts and possibly elsewhere.",Indica,,,22.0,Tropical Sweet,Relaxing Relaxing
3522,Purple Emergency,"This rare medical strain has THC levels that exceed 19% in some samples, making it a particularly potent choice for treating a range of health problems, including anxiety, low mood, chronic pain, and everyday stresses. Purple Emergency is said to be an indica-dominant hybrid, but the exact ratio of sativa to indica is hard to determine. The effects are mostly physical, with deep body relaxation and pain relief. This strain isn't recommended as primary treatment for conditions that require CBD extracts, including childhood seizure disorders, as the levels of that chemical are very low, less than 1%. As its name suggests, Purple Emergency has dark purple buds with a healthy layer of crystals. The aroma and flavor of this strain are sweet and smooth. With little available data on the subject, it's hard to say what the most common side effects of Purple Emergency are, but dry mouth and red eyes are usually a good bet when using any strain of marijuana. This strain can be found in the South Bay Area in California, but it doesn't have much of a fan base elsewhere.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,19.0,Sweet,Relaxing Relaxing
3523,Purple Express,"Purple Express is a 10% pure-indica hybrid strain, but its specific history is unclear. The same is true of nearly every detail about this decidedly rare medical option. With pure indica parentage, this strain likely delivers an intensely physical high that is great for relaxation, pain relief, and anxiety. Like other indicas, it's typically best used late at night or on days with few activities, as it probably can generate significant couch-lock and sedative effects. Nobody seems to know which strains were combined to create Purple Express, but the name suggests a connection to Pineapple Express, a popular hybrid. The ""Purple"" heredity could refer to the strain's purple coloring or to any of a number of ""Purps"" parents descended from the original Mendocino Purps. A grape-like aroma and flavor are likely, though there are few reports on taste, smell, or appearance. Reports on adverse effects are likewise very hard to come by, but patients should expect the usual: dry mouth, red eyes, and paranoia. Purple Express may be found in Amsterdam, but it's far from common in other parts of the world.",Indica,,,,Pungent Sweet Grape,Body High Sleepy Body High Sleepy
3524,Purple Goblin,"This indica-dominant hybrid (ratio of sativa/indica is unknown) is the offspring of Mendocino Purps (aka Purps) and Green Goblin (aka Green Crack), both strong, popular strains. It's unclear how much of that potency carries down to Purple Goblin, as THC contents aren't widely known. The same goes with CBD, the chemical often used to treat seizure disorders and some other conditions, though it's probably safe to assume it's not terribly high. As its genes suggest, Purple Goblin is a body-centered strain, with a deeply calming body high and limited cerebral buzz. Beyond that, there's little available information on the precise effects, or even on what conditions this strain is best for. But indicas are generally best at relieving physical pain, alleviating anxiety, and protecting against depression. This strain has a berry aroma and most likely a similar flavor. The bud is dark green and purple, with a hairy coat of trichomes on the surface. There are few reports of adverse effects from smoking Purple Goblin, but dry mouth and red eyes are always possible, as is paranoia. This strain definitely isn't easy to find, but it might be found in the American West.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Earthy Sweet Spicy Fruity Herbal Berry Pungent,Body High Relaxing Body High Relaxing
3525,Purple Fire,"This hybrid's name is well deserved, for after firing up on it, you will experience a beautiful high. To begin, the appearance is beautiful, featuring large amounts of reddish hairs against a purpled / red colored bud, which are slathered with crystals. There are a moderate amount of leaves, which are bright green. It has a medium amount of aroma, which is close to a sniff at the produce isle. The taste is like that of a grape which has been fermented in spices. The buzz is a body and head combination, which will leave you full of energy and wanting to get creative. Medicinally, it is used as a pain reliever, and to treat depression, and paranoia. The side effects after smoking this are nice, the body buzz giving you a smooth feeling, as well as taking care of minor pains, and then you get a hit of sleepiness. All in all this is a nice, full bodied balanced weed.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,13.0,Sugary Earthy Sweet Spicy Herbal,Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria
3526,Purple Jack,"This combination of two perennial favorites – Purple Kush and Jack Herer – is a sativa-dominant hybrid, though the exact balance of sativa to indica is something of a mystery. But Purple Jack likely has a fair amount of both gene types, since Purple Kush is a heavy indica and Jack Herer a heavy sativa. THC levels are low in this strain, regularly testing at below 10%. It's harder to come by reliable data on CBD levels, however, so Purple Jack probably shouldn't be used as the only means of treating seizures or other conditions that respond to that cannabinoid. But it's ideal for patients who want a relaxing but energizing cerebral alternative to more potent choices. Though dominated by sativa genes, Purple Jack also produces physical effects, including couch-lock. It's likely a good choice for anxiety and irritability, but otherwise medical uses aren't widely reported. This strain has a musky, spicy aroma with hints of Skunk, while the flavor is smooth and musky with notes of hash and pine. The nugs are dark and lime green, with a fluffy appearance, purple leaves, and a light dusting of trichomes.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,25.0,Earthy Citrus Spicy Hash Herbal Skunky Honey Pine,Cerebral Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing Uplifting Cerebral Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing Uplifting
3527,Purple Maroc,"This pure sativa strain (sativa/indica ratio of 100:0) comes from the Ketama region of Morocco, though its exact origins remain something of a mystery. It has relatively high THC levels, which exceed 16% in available tests. That makes Purple Maroc a very effective choice for treating anxiety and depression, though the full medical uses of this strain are hard to determine. The effects are mostly happy, a cerebral result of the sativa-dominant genes. But with very low CBD concentrations, less than 1%, this shouldn't be a first choice for treating problems that are relieved with that cannabinoid. That includes severe pediatric seizure disorders. Purple Maroc produces a sweet, fruity aroma and a sweet and sour flavor. As its name suggests, the buds and leaves of this strain have dark purple hues. Since side effect reports are scarce, it's hard to say which are the most likely, but dry mouth and red eyes are usually common. Presumably Purple Maroc can be found in Morocco and possibly Europe, but it's definitely uncommon in the United States, on or off the legal medical marijuana markets.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,16.0,Earthy Sweet Sour Fruity Berry,Happy Relaxing Uplifting Happy Relaxing Uplifting
3528,Purple M&M,"THC levels vary in this cross of M&M Pure Kush and Purple Urkle, but available tests suggest they hover around 13%. That makes this a relatively modest choice for conditions that require THC. The presence of CBD, meanwhile, is very limited, less than 0.2%. That means this strain is best for treating THC-related conditions than disorders that respond to CBD, such as epilepsy. The indica genes are dominant in Purple M&M, though not by much. The exact ratio of sativa to indica is unknown. The high is body-focused, with a calming, sleepy sensation. But there are also psychoactive cerebral effects stemming from this strain's sativa heritage. Purple M&M can be used to relieve anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. It has a smooth pine flavor and a skunky aroma. The buds have a speckled, leafy green-and-brown appearance with few trichomes. Adverse effects likely include dry mouth and red eyes, though there are few reports along these lines. This strain definitely isn't widely available. It might be found on the West Coast, though even there it's scarce.

3529,Purple NYC,"This hybrid strain is a specialized treat, hard to find but worth trying at least once. The THC levels are moderate, though the actual numbers are unclear. Purple NYC Diesel provides a relaxing physical high great for melting away stress and body aches. This strain has the genes of Sour Diesel and Mendocino Purps (aka ""The Purps""), but beyond that it's unknown what plants were involved in the breeding process. It's indica-dominant but, again, the exact proportion of sativa to indica is hard to come by. Mostly this is because Purple NYC Diesel is something of a regional specialty, uncommon outside New York and the West Coast. It can be bought at some California dispensaries, but otherwise it's rarely offered on the legal market. This strain can be an effective treatment for insomnia and anxiety, as well as chronic pain and lack of appetite. Purple NYC Diesel has a light citrus aroma and a faint chemical taste from its Diesel origins. It's not a great strain for getting things done during the day, but it can hit the spot late at night.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Sweet Diesel Grape Spicy Berry Pungent,Giggly Relaxing Giggly Relaxing

3531,Romulan Cotton Candy,"This indica-dominant medical strain is hard to find, and its lack of potency may be one reason why. THC levels can top 15%, but that doesn't put this strain on the top shelf. Meanwhile, CBD numbers are decidedly low, with that chemical making up less than 0.3% of this strain. Not surprisingly, Romulan Cotton Candy is a cross between Romulan, a popular indica, and Cotton Candy, a sativa-dominant hybrid. The exact ratio of sativa to indica in this strain is unknown. But the indica genes create a calming body effect complemented by a clear-headed cerebral high provided by the sativa genes. The experience is spacey but energized. Best for treating anxiety, headaches, and nausea, Romulan Cotton Candy is also helpful with chronic pain and lack of appetite, as it creates a strong case of the munchies. This strain has a definite cotton candy aroma with notes of fruit, while it tastes of sweet candy and pepper. Aside from hunger, potential adverse effects include cottonmouth and dry eyes. Romulan Cotton Candy isn't particularly popular anywhere, though it can probably be found in some Colorado dispensaries.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,15.0,Sweet Candy Fruity,Cerebral Energizing Relaxing Cerebral Energizing Relaxing
3532,Queen Green,"Queen Green is a strong marijuana strain that has a mushy green appearance. It is a cross between Green Crack and Space Queen, hence the name Queen Green. It has a very high THC level and an extremely powerful buzz that takes over your entire body immediately. It has a very interesting and pungent flavor, which has a good combination of nutty and spicy tastes. It also has that hint of earthy flavor that produces a nice, soothing effect on the body. Queen Green's aroma is a very nice as well. Its aroma is a blend of earthy, nutty, spicy and herbal odors. Queen Green mostly has positive effects on your body. It makes you feel extremely euphoric and happy as soon as you smoke it. It also energizes and makes you feel creative. Therefore, it is good for when you want to work on something that requires creativity. This marijuana strain is used for treating a number of conditions. It is excellent for curing anxiety, stress and depression, which is why anxiety patients often rely on Queen Green for mitigating their stress. It can also be used for soothing high blood pressure and can provide relief from terrible mood swings. Irregular and hard bowel movements can also be treated with Queen Green.

J’s Famous Kush packs a clear-headed high that’s great for the daytime and should be avoided by any users who suffer from anxiety. The high starts with a subtle lift that leaves you uplifted and happy with a sense of laser-sharp focus, helping you tackle whatever task comes your way. As this cerebral high builds, a slight body high will overcome you, erasing any aches and pains and replacing them with pangs of hunger. Because of its effects, J’s Famous Kush is the perfect choice for treating conditions such as appetite loss, spasticity, chronic stress, and chronic fatigue. This bud has a classic flavor any connoisseur will love, with an earthy taste that’s accented by sweet herbs and peppery skunk.

3552,Sagamatha Blueberry,"Sagamatha Blueberry, also known as ""Sagamatha Blueberry Bud"" to many members of the cannabis community, was created by the infamous DJ Short at the Sagamatha Seeds farms as a Blueberry phenotype that was isolated and back-bred. This dank bud is a 100% pure indica strain that boasts a high average THC level ranging from 22-24%. Sagamatha Blueberry buds have round thick bright neon green dense nugs that have rich amber undertones and a spattering of bright fiery orange hairs. These nugs are covered with minty green leaves and a caked on layer of thick crystal white trichomes. This strain has a delicious taste of sweet blueberry with a hint of vanilla that intensifies upon exhale and an aroma of tasty blueberry tarts. Users describe the Sagarmatha Blueberry high as one that provides an immediate long-lasting uplifted sense of euphoria and mind relief. This head high is powerful and potent but not too overwhelming. This is accompanied by a moderate warming body buzz that isn't sedative but leaves you utterly relaxed and at ease.

3553,Sensativa,"Sensativa is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid (60% sativa/40% indica) strain that has unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and a THC level ranging from 14-17% on average. Sensativa users describe the high as one that has a slowly building onset of an uplifting and motivating cerebral head high. This head high peaks and then slowly falls into a sedative warming body buzz that leaves you calm, relaxed, and completely couch-locked. As this sativa body high continues, a sense of the munchies will build and peak, leaving you desperate for food just before you fall into a state of deep sedation. Due to these potent sativa and indica effects, Sensativa is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as appetite loss, chronic pain due to injury or illness, muscle spasms, and sleep disorders, including insomnia. Sensativa buds have dense leafy spade-shaped dark olive green nugs with patches of light minty green and a sparse layering of dark red furry hairs. These nugs are dusted with a fine layer of milky white trichomes and are dripping with sweet sticky resin. This strain has a taste of sweet fruity citrus with an incredibly smooth exhale and an aroma of sweet hashy fruit.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,40% Indica,60% Sativa,,Orange Citrus Fruity,Body High Cerebral Body High Cerebral
3554,Shiva X,"This potent indica-heavy hybrid (sativa/indica ratio unknown) gets both its name and its most potent genes from Shiva, itself a potent indica named after Shiva the Destroyer, a Hindu God who has the power to both give and take life. Shiva was mixed with an unknown sativa to create Shiva X, which originally went by the name Chuck Norris due to its serious kick. This strain is nothing if not powerful and should be avoided by newcomers. Exact THC numbers are scarce, but likely top 20%. CBD levels are an even greater mystery, but if anything, that recommends against using Shiva X as exclusive treatment for epilepsy or other conditions treated with CBD. This strain hits hard and fast, creating a potent head rush followed by strong euphoria. The experience blends sativa and indica genetics, hitting both the head and body. Side effects are possible, including increased heart rate in the first few minutes after smoking, cottonmouth, and dry eyes. Paranoia is also reported. The exact medical properties of Shiva X are generally unknown, though it may help with anxiety and mood issues. The strain has a fruity smell and taste, and it has a light green appearance with orange hairs and a layer of trichomes.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,20.0,Citrus Spicy Tropical Fruity Skunky Pine,Cerebral Euphoria Happy Uplifting Cerebral Euphoria Happy Uplifting
3555,Shoreline,"Shoreline is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain created by breeders at the infamous Sensi Seeds farms as an older phenotype of Sensi Skunk. This strain first appeared in the 1980's as an ""old school skunk"" and gets its name from the Shoreline Amphitheater, where the Grateful Dead had a monumentally successful concert debut. This dank bud boasts a moderate THC level ranging from 18-23% on average and a myriad of potent indica and sativa effects. Users describe the Shoreline high as one that leaves you intensely euphoric and uplifted with a sense of social encouragement and creative inspiration. This is accompanied by a mild warming body buzz that provides significant pain relief and leaves you grounded and relaxed with a mild sense of spaciness. Due to these potent indica and sativa effects, Shoreline is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress and anxiety, nausea, and appetite loss. Shoreline has an aroma of sweet earthy skunk and a taste of sweet earthy citrus with a hint of skunk.

3557,Sleestack X Skunk,"You won't find this rare crossbreed in many legal dispensaries, but it's a common source of hashish and cannabis resin products. Sometimes known as SleeSkunk, this strain blends the well-known genetics of Afghan Skunk, an indica, and the much more obscure heredity of Sleestack, itself a rare hybrid of uncertain genetic balance. The end result has a sativa/indica ratio of 70:30, making for strong heady effects. Not much else is widely known about the high this strain produces, however. That also goes for the concentrations of THC and CBD in Sleestack X Skunk. But given its popularity as a hash plant, this strain is presumably quite potent with THC. The lack of data on CBD, on the other hand, recommends against using it as a sole treatment for seizures or other conditions that are treated with CBD. Aside from anxiety, it's not clear what conditions respond best to this medial choice. Smoking this as dried marijuana will likely produce typical side effects, including cottonmouth and bloodshot eyes. Smoking it in the form of hash could lead to somewhat different effects.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,30% Indica,70% Sativa,,Earthy Citrus Sweet Sour Hash Lemon,Cerebral Energizing Uplifting Cerebral Energizing Uplifting

3559,Sloppy Bowl,"Sloppy bowl is a 100% pure indica hybrid strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and a moderate THC level ranging from 14-19% on average. Sloppy Bowl users describe the high as one that has an almost immediate onset of a calming yet giggly social head high that leaves you activated and aroused yet somehow completely relaxed. This head high is ideal for social situations, as you'll be talkative yet utterly at ease. This cerebral high is accompanied by a relaxing mellow body stone that leaves you spacey but comfortable with a pretty intense case of the munchies. Due to these potent indica effects, Sloppy Bowl is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as mild to moderate cases of depression, chronic stress or anxiety, and mood swings. Sloppy Bowl has a potent aroma of harsh minty pine and a taste that is equally as harsh with minty pine and a hint of spice upon exhale. Sloppy Bowl buds have super fluffy minty green popcorn-shaped nugs that are almost completely covered with tiny dark olive green leaves.

3563,Sorry Sucker,"Sorry Sucker is a rare hybrid mix of indica and sativa, though it isn't widely known which is dominant, let alone the exact ratio. The same is true of the amount of THC and CBD in this strain, though that alone means it's safe to assume CBD content is very low, too low for use in treating seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to the chemical. Sorry Sucker is said to be a somewhat potent daytime strain, but not notably so. The high mixes sativa and indica effects but leans toward cerebral, with an energized shot of euphoria. It's a good way to treat anxiety, depression, nerve pain, and chronic pain. It's an especially effective medication for multiple sclerosis, tremors, and mood disorders. The smell is floral and sweet, while the flavor has fruity hints of cherry and ice cream. The appearance is light green with golden yellow hairs on the bud. Reports of adverse effects are few and far between, but it's usually a safe bet to expect dry mouth, red eyes, and possibly paranoia.

3564,Sour Cherry,"Though its name suggests a blend of Sour Diesel and Cherry Pie, in fact Sour Cherry descends from Sage 'N' Sour OG and Buddha's Sister, both Dutch hybrids. The smell is unique and not entirely pleasant, with strong notes of cherry and rotten fruit. This strain tastes of cherry, lemon, lime, and menthol, as well as sour notes of whiskey. Sour Cherry is a sativa/indica hybrid with an unknown ratio of sativa to indica, though the effects lean toward indica. There's no publicly available data on THC levels in this strain, and the same goes for CBD contents, but the lack of information on CBD alone suggests Sour Cherry isn't a great choice for patients who need that chemical to treat seizures or other conditions. The THC, however much there may be, produces a strong, calming body buzz that's ideal for relieving the symptoms of low mood, chronic physical pain, and sleepless nights. Reports on adverse effects are hard to come by, but users can expect red eyes and dry mouth, as well as possible paranoia and dizziness. Sour Cherry can be found in a handful of dispensaries in Oregon but isn't popular much of anywhere.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Lemon Lime Cherry Menthol,Body High Relaxing Body High Relaxing
3565,Spawntanica,"Spawntanica is a heavily indica dominant hybrid (90% indica/10% sativa) strain created by breeders at the infamous Spawntanica Seeds farms. This dank bud has unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and boats a THC level ranging from 15-19% on average. Spawntanica users describe the high as having an almost immediate onset of a mildly uplifting cerebral head high that is accompanied by a warming body buzz that slowly spreads from the upper head and back of the neck throughout the rest of the body. This provides calming mind relief as well as significant sedative relaxation and body relief. Due to these potent effects, Spawntanica is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as insomnia and other sleeping disorders, chronic stress and anxiety, and appetite loss. Spawntanica has an aroma of crisp fresh pine with a hint of earth and a taste of fresh lemony pine that sweetens upon exhale. The Spawntanica buds have dark olive green spade-shaped nugs that are insanely dense and leafy. These nugs are spattered with a thin layer of almost translucent short amber hairs and are caked with a thick layer of frosty huge, oversized white crystal trichomes and sweet sticky resin.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,90% Indica,10% Sativa,17.0,Pine Sweet,Body High Cerebral Relaxing Body High Cerebral Relaxing

3567,Sour Romulan,"Sour Romulan is an Indica dominant strain that sits at 80% Indica and 20% Sativa. The high is very soothing and strong - typical of Indica, but with the addition of focus and attention. Very cerebral effects are king with euphoric and delicate muscle relaxation mixed right in. The spacey type of state is reported to last for around three hours, and there are no troublesome lingering side effects to deal with. Patients who medicate with this strain say that is great for relaxing in general, depression, anxiety, good for pain relief, good for OCD, useful as a muscle relaxant, and very helpful with stress. The appearance of this strain is beautiful in an alien sort of way - full of bright oranges, mixes of violets and reds, deep purples, and neon greens. The aroma in the beginning is similar to a grape-flavored sour candy mixed with musty earth.

3568,Sour Pineapple,"Sour Pineapple merges the genetics of two beloved, sativa-dominant strains, Sour Diesel and Pineapple Kush. Sour Pineapple is a sativa-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of roughly 70:30) that is known to be an effective treatment for anxiety, everyday stress, and nausea. The sativa genes make for a decidedly cerebral high, with clear-headed thinking and a strong boost of energy. THC levels are between 13% and 18% in available tests, making this a mid-shelf strain in terms of potency. CBD contents are harder to come by, but that alone means Sour Pineapple shouldn't be used as the sole treatment for conditions that respond to this cannabinoid, especially seizure disorders. Sour Pineapple has a pungent, Skunky aroma and a dank, pungent flavor. The bud is multi-colored, with dark green leaves, amber hairs, and a modest dusting of trichomes. There are few public reports of adverse effects, but dry mouth and red eyes are common in most cannabis strains. This strain is found mostly on the medical marijuana markets of Washington State and Oregon, but it's not especially popular anywhere in the United States.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,30% Indica,70% Sativa,13.0,Earthy Sweet Diesel Pineapple Sour Fruity,Energizing Euphoria Happy Uplifting Energizing Euphoria Happy Uplifting
3569,Special K,"It features a smell that is both spicy and citrus. It offers a citrus taste that is very enjoyable. This is a pure Sativa strain that is a hybrid of Northern Lights and Afghani. It is potent with THC around 24% and it isn't recommended for first time users of cannabis. Special K is bright green in color. As the time comes near for harvesting, orange hairs will emerge. They will become brighter and brighter in the days leading up to the harvest. The leaves offer a very generous amount of crystals. The high from Special K is deliberate and long lasting. It can result in couch lock and it is hard to get much done mentally. It is best to use this strain when you will be at home and you don't need to get much else done. It can help with reducing stress and anxiety.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,24.0,Citrus Sweet Spicy Grassy Herbal Berry Woody,Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Relaxing Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Relaxing
3570,Spurkle,"Spurkle's genes definitely lean in the direction of its very popular indica-dominant parents, G13 and Purple Kush. The sativa/indica ratio in this strain is 60:40, and that makes for a long lasting high featuring a calming body buzz and intense sleepiness. Not surprisingly, then, Spurkle is recommended for the treatment of insomnia. It's also an effective means of treating ADHD, multiple sclerosis and other forms of spasticity. This strain carries on the potency of its parents, with THC levels exceeding 20% in at least one publicly available test. CBD numbers are much harder to come by, and that's usually a pretty clear indication that a strain shouldn't be used on conditions that require CBD, including severe seizure disorders. Spurkle has a sweet diesel aroma and a pungent Kush flavor, along with long, dense buds with rust red hairs. Users should expect the typical side effects, such as red eyes and dry mouth, though credible reports are hard to come by. Born in Southern California, Spurkle is sold on the medical market in San Diego – and that's about the only place it's found.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,40% Indica,60% Sativa,20.0,Sweet Diesel,Body High Body High

3572,Star Nebula,"This super-galactic strain is indica-dominant, but the exact ratio of indica to sativa is hard to come by. It's a cross of Sensi Storm, a powerful indica-dominant hybrid, and Nebula, a sativa-dominant favorite. THC levels in Star Nebula aren't widely reported, but each parent has a relatively high concentration of the cannabinoid, so this strain likely also has high levels, possibly well over 20% in some cases. Even less is known about its CBD contents, though that alone suggests this strain shouldn't be used as the sole treatment of seizure disorders or other health conditions that respond to CBD. If its genetics are any guide, Star Nebula creates a powerful euphoria and a strong sedated sensation. Beyond that, there isn't much consistent information available about this strain's effects. But it is known to be an effective treatment for chronic pain, lack of appetite, insomnia, and anxiety. Star Nebula smells of lemon and Skunk, while the nugs have a dark green appearance with orange hairs. This strain is probably most common on the West Coast, though it might also be found in Colorado or even on the black market.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,20.0,Chemical Spicy Lemon Skunky Pungent,Euphoria Relaxing Euphoria Relaxing
3573,Super MelonHead Kush,"Though Super MelonHead Kush is known to be an indica-dominant hybrid, there isn't enough public information to gauge how much of it is sativa and how much indica. It's a close cousin to Super Kush, and in fact the two may simply be the same strain masquerading under different names. Like that strain, Super MelonHead Kush is a cross of Northern Lights #5 and Hindu Kush, both very popular in their own rights. There is little public data regarding THC levels in this strain, but there isn't any evidence to suggest they're especially high. CBD levels are also something of a mystery, but that alone means Super MelonHead Kush shouldn't be used as the sole means of treating seizures or other problems that respond to CBD. The indica-driven high is mostly physical, with calming, couch-lock effects, sleepiness, and intense hunger. That makes it a very useful tool in treating wasting and eating disorders, as well as insomnia and chronic pain. This strain has a fruity mango flavor, and it smells of watermelon. The buds are lime green with brown hairs. Look for Super MelonHead Kush in San Diego but don't expect to find it elsewhere.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Fruity,Relaxing Relaxing
3574,Sugar Skunk,"The genetics of Sugar Skunk are a little unclear, but this strain is known to be an indica-heavy hybrid (sativa/indica ratio unknown). It's a potent, pleasant choice for late nights and lazy days in front of the tube. Specific THC values are scarce, so it's hard to say just how potent this strain is, but it's definitely up there. The same can't be said about CBD contents, however, since the lack of public data suggests very low concentration. Patients who need that cannabinoid to treat seizures or other conditions shouldn't use Sugar Skunk as their only means of marijuana treatment. Rather, this strain produces a strong, happy body buzz that's ideal for medicating anxiety, nausea, and everyday stress. The aroma from Sugar Skunk is sweet and dank while the flavor is bittersweet, with citrus notes. The nugs are dense and dark green in appearance. Side effects are possible with any marijuana strain, and while there are few details on this one, they probably include cottonmouth and red eyes. Patients may find Sugar Skunk in medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado and Southern California.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,,Citrus Sweet Dank,Happy Relaxing Happy Relaxing
3575,Sublime,"Sublime is a sativa dominant hybrid (70% sativa/30% indica) strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and general disagreement in the cannabis community about its origins. It is widely thought that it is of the OG Kush family, although it is not known for sure. This dank bud boasts a moderately high THC level that ranges from 18-22% on average and a sweet aroma and taste of earthy floral spice with a hint of pineapple upon exhale. Users describe the Sublime high as being akin to drinking a pot of straight espresso. You'll feel an intensely uplifted cerebral head high almost immediately after smoking that leaves you insanely energetic and focused with high levels of motivation and creativity. This is accompanied by a pain relieving body buzz that's warming and relaxing, leaving you completely at ease with feelings of bliss and slight sedation. Although this high may be a little intense upon the initial hit, it becomes very manageable after the first few minutes. Due to these effects, Sublime is an ideal strain for treating nausea, stress, and pain. These buds have medium-sized dark forest green round grape-shaped dense nugs with almost translucent amber hairs and a fine layer of sandy white trichomes.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,30% Indica,70% Sativa,20.0,Earthy Sweet Pineapple Spicy Tropical Herbal Fruity Woody,Cerebral Energizing Euphoria Happy Uplifting Cerebral Energizing Euphoria Happy Uplifting
3576,Super OG Master Kush,"The indica genes are dominant in Super OG Master Kush, a three-way cross of Super Kush, OG Kush, and Master Kush (exact sativa/indica ratio unclear). This strain is said to be very potent, though there are few public reports on its THC levels. The same is true of CBD concentrations, which are reportedly lower than 1%, too low to recommend Super OG Master Kush as medication for severe epilepsy or other conditions that require CBD treatments. But it is known to be an effective form of relief for patients who suffer from anxiety, lack of appetite, muscle spasms, GI symptoms, and everyday stress. It's perfect for both encouraging hunger and treating upset stomach. The high is a blend of calming, euphoric body buzz and potent psychoactive effects. Super OG Master Kush has a citrus flavor and a dank smell of pine needles. The huge buds are bright green with gold hues, orange hairs, and a layer of frosty trichomes. This strain may produce side effects including cottonmouth and watery eyes, though details are scarce.

This mild orange and apple green nugget with dark hues is heavily covered with sticky trichomes, resembling morning dew. A mix of cerebral sativa and heightened indica, Super Blue Dream is a harmonious cure for pain and stress. The funky smell of blueberry and mint with hints of creamy yogurt gives an energetic uplift to productivity and creativity- a must-have for workaholics. The sweet haze of cream and yogurt with sensual clouds of mint and blueberry unlock the brain and give an average buzz of about 1 to 1.5 hours. Easy to smoke and inhale, this euphoric strain leaves you talkative and uplifted and is a cool way to relieve your stress, anxiety, depression, nausea and pain. The nugget is crispy and dry and might make eyes and mouth dry.

3579,Sweet Dutch,"Sweet Dutch, also known as ""Dutch Treat"" to most members of the cannabis community, is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy. This dank bud boasts a THC level ranging from 16-18% on average and is considered to be a staple strain in the Coffee Shops of Amsterdam. Users describe the Sweet Dutch high as having an immediate cerebral uplifting head rush that leaves you happy and focused. This is followed by a clean and calming numbing sensation that slowly spreads from the head and neck throughout the rest of the body, leaving you sleepy and sedated but not too couch-locked. Due to these potent effects, Dutch Treat is said to be an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress, pain due to injury or illness, depression, and insomnia. Dutch Treat has an aroma of sweet earthy pine and a taste of earthy pine that intensifies and sweetens upon exhale. Sweet Dutch buds have fluffy dark olive green popcorn shaped nugs that are completely covered in long thin fiery orange hairs and a fine layer of milky white trichomes. These nugs are completely sticky and practically dripping with syrupy sweet resin.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,80% Indica,20% Sativa,17.0,Pepper,Relaxing Relaxing
3580,Tessa,"Not many people have sampled this rare delicacy, but those lucky few seem to think very highly of it. That might be due in part to the high THC levels, rumored to exceed 22% in some tests. That puts it among the most potent available. CBD levels are hard to come by, but Tessa definitely isn't known for producing large amounts of this cannabinoid. That means this strain is a poor choice as an exclusive treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD. Tessa is a cross of The Black, a potent near-pure indica; Blueberry, a famed pure indica; and Dynamite, also an indica-heavy plant. Those genes make Tessa itself an indica-dominant strain, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica is unclear. The high is intensely physical, but beyond that not much is known about it. Couch-lock effects are a fair bet, as is sleepiness. That could make this a good choice for treating insomnia. It's also likely helpful with anxiety and depression, but otherwise the medical benefits of this strain are unclear. Tessa has a sweet flavor and a fruity aroma.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,22.0,Earthy Sweet Candy Fruity Berry Vanilla,Relaxing Relaxing
3581,The Wiz,"The Wiz, also known as ""Khalifa Kush"" to many members of the cannabis community, is a sativa dominant hybrid (80% sativa/20% indica) strain created by breeders at the infamous Karmaceuticals farms that was named after the famous rapper Wiz Khalifa. The exact genetics of this strain are unknown due to breeder secrecy, although it is widely agreed that it is an OG phenotype. This dank bud boasts a high THC level ranging from 14-22% on average and a myriad of both sativa and indica effects. Users describe The Wiz high as being super heavy for a sativa strain. You'll feel a strong cerebral head rush felt primarily in the forehead and eyes followed by a confusing combination of feelings of motivation and calming sedation. Due to these effects, The Wiz is an ideal strain for treating conditions such as glaucoma, insomnia, chronic stress, and mild to moderate cases of depression. The Wiz has an aroma of sour lemon pine and a taste of sweet and sour lemon with a hint of pungent pine upon exhale. The Wiz buds have small to medium-sized light minty green grape-shaped dense nugs that are spattered with thin fiery orange hairs. These nugs are super frosty with white trichomes and sticky with sweet resin.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,20% Indica,80% Sativa,18.0,Earthy Pine,Cerebral Cerebral
3582,Top 44,"Top 44 is a heavily indica dominant hybrid (90% indica/10% sativa) strain that was created by breeders at the infamous Nirvana Seeds. Its parentage is largely unknown due to the secrecy of its breeders, although it does boast a moderate THC level ranging from 8-15% on average. Top 44 is well known among the cannabis community for its intense couch lock and its description as the ""perfect nighttime bud."" Users describe the Top 44 high as an intense body high that is felt first in the head, face, and eyes before slowly melting throughout the body. This feeling is accompanied by a sense of euphoria that is still mellow and leaves you clear-headed. Following this initial high, users slowly fade into an intense couch lock that is extremely sedative and eases them into a deep and peaceful sleep. Because of these potent sedative effects, Top 44 is an ideal treatment for patients suffering from conditions such as chronic pain, nausea, insomnia, and depression. The Top 44 bud has a sweet and fruity aroma that is reminiscent of a lemon drop candy and a taste of fruity caramel that is extremely smooth upon exhale. This strain has big fluffy leafy nugs that are dark green with thin fiery orange hairs, a thick layer of caked-on crystals, and sweet resin.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,90% Indica,10% Sativa,11.5,Lemon Sweet Fruity,Relaxing Relaxing

This dank bud boasts an average THC level ranging from 10-20% and a potent myriad of both indica and sativa effects. Users describe the Teenone high as having an onset of an almost psychedelic head high that leaves you intensely energetic and uplifted. This is followed by a mellow relaxing body stone that slowly fades into a heavy full-body stone that leaves you utterly couch-locked and completely sedated. As the high continues, you'll experience significant body and mind relief and fade into a deep and peaceful sleep. Due to these potent effects, The Teenone is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic anxiety or stress, depression, or chronic pain due to injury or illness. The Teenone buds have small compact dense dark olive green spade-shaped nugs that are specked with thick furry fiery orange hairs. These nugs are caked with a frosty layer of white crystal trichomes and a fine sprinkling of sweet sticky resin.

This means that while Trinity Blueberry may be effective at treating seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to CBD, it shouldn't be used to treat pediatric conditions. But it's an effective medical tool in treating anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Trinity Blueberry is a sativa-dominant hybrid, though it has a near-even balance of sativa and indica (sativa/indica ratio of roughly 55:45). It's a mix of Trinity County Kush out of Northern California and Blueberry, a legendary indica that also has roots in the Golden State. The high is euphoric and happy, with most of the effects centered on the head. But it's also deeply relaxing.

The high, what there is, is almost entirely cerebral, with a dose of happiness.

Neither is the CBD content of Snow Bud, which is likely a descendant of an Afghani landrace and a South African strain. But the limited information available on CBD suggests there's not enough of it to effectively treat seizure disorders or other medical conditions that respond to that cannabinoid.

3797,DinaChem,"Dinachem is a 65% Sativa 35% Indica strain made by crossing Dinafem and Original ChemDawg 91. Its appearance is nice, with tight buds that are eye catching green with plenty of crystals, and very little leaf. The odor is a mix and match between lemons, pine and gas. It has a very rich taste, with a slight lemon undertone to the fuel and pine. The strong high is that of a body and head buzz, but that will not give you couchlock. After smoking, feelings of happiness and upbeatness are common. Medicinally, it is used for pain, nausea, stress, loss of appetite, and occasionally depression.

3798,Cinderella OG,"Cinderella OG is a sativa-dominant product of Cinderella 99 and OG Kush, two highly powerful sativa-dominant hybrids. That potency apparently doesn't carry down to this strain, which rates rather poorly among patients. The exact THC concentration isn't widely known, and the same goes for CBD, but neither appears to be very high. The balance of sativa to indica isn't entirely clear, but it appears to have a ratio of at least 70:30. Not much is known about Cinderella OG's effects, but as a sativa-dominant strain, it is likely centered on the head rather than the body. That should mean increased energy and mental clarity, though there isn't enough available information to say for sure. The same is true of this strain's medical effects. But sativas tend to be psychoactive, with sensory effects, making them best for treating anxiety, depression, nausea, appetite problems, migraines, and pain. Like other details on Cinderella OG, it's hard to determine its typical taste and smell. This strain definitely isn't popular, and few patients have tried it.

Wappa buds have airy bright neon green Christmas tree-shaped nugs that are completely covered with curly leaves and frosty fine white crystal trichomes and sweet sticky resin. Users describe the Wappa high as having a powerful onset that is somehow pleasant rather than jarring. This onset leaves you with a luminous high that makes you spacey and introspective, oftentimes leading you to get lost in your own mind. You'll also experience heightened awareness of what is going on around you even though you may be non-responsive. This bud provides significant pain relief in both mind and body without the sedation and couch lock typical of indicas and indica dominant hybrids.

With THC content that falls anywhere in between 20 and 25%, it proves to be one of the finest hybrid strains you can get your hands on. The strain produces tight nuggets that are bright green in color with good trichome coverage. Ginger Ale is a frosty strain and it may not necessarily appeal to most cannabis users. But then again, it has an amazing taste and smell that is more or less the same. You can expect floral and sweet flavors, which is quite smooth during the inhale and exhale. The strain is a hard hitter. It will hit you with everything it's got which is why it is not recommended for individuals new to smoking cannabis. However, its effects are rather calming and you will feel a body buzz unlike any other. Most individuals may even pass out due to its potency.

3818,Super Girl Scout Cookies,"As with many cannabis strains, there appears to be some dispute about the exact genetics of Super Girl Scout Cookies. Most agree it's a blend of Durban Poison, OG Kush, and Cherry Kush, but some say it's a sativa-dominant hybrid while others insist it's a near-pure indica. This strain isn't widely available, so it's hard to know for sure, but the mostly physical high suggests the indica genes are important in this strain, if not dominant. The effects include a calming body buzz that's effective in relieving muscle cramps and mood disorders. THC concentrations aren't widely reported, but like it's parents, this strain is said to be quite potent. A similar lack of data about CBD levels means patients, including those with seizure disorders, shouldn't use Super Girl Scout Cookies as a source of that cannabinoid. The nugs are dense and green with orange hairs, but there isn't much information available about the taste or smell of this strain. Negative effects likely include dry mouth and dry eyes, though reliable reports are hard to come by.

The indica high is mostly physical, with deep relaxation and couch-lock effects, though the sativa genes also provide mental focus. This strain has a Skunky aroma and flavor with notes of sour citrus. The nugs are a multicolored blend of dark green, bluish-purple, and bright red. THC levels are modestly impressive in Ogre OG, reaching a maximum of nearly 19% in available tests. On the other hand, CBD is scarce in this strain, making it a poor choice for the alleviation of seizures or other conditions that respond to that chemical.

3829,Power Plant,"This relatively upbeat strain is an inbred descendant of native South African sativas, though it also has some indica genes (65:35 sativa/indica ratio). THC levels vary, as they do with any strain, but available data suggests they're not especially high, at least not on average. CBD levels are sometimes high, especially for a strain that appeals to recreational uses. Even so, it varies and isn't generally high enough to suggest Power Plant as a treatment for seizures or other conditions that can be treated with CBD. Instead, it's good for anxiety and depression, fatigue, ADHD, inflammation, migraine headaches, and lack of appetite. Use this strain for early afternoons or, if you wake and bake, mornings, as it provides a clear-headed boost of energy, with a creative spark and happy euphoria. Power Plant has a sweet taste with earthy, woody flavors. The aroma is similarly sweet, earthy, and woody. The bud is light green with light brown flecks and a silvery dusting of trichomes. Red eyes and cottonmouth are both common side effects, while paranoia and mild headaches are also possible for some users. This isn't the world's most popular strain, but it's found in a surprising number of legal markets, both in the American West and in Europe.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,35% Indica,65% Sativa,15.0,Earthy Peppery Spicy Herbal Pungent Woody,Creative Energizing Euphoria Happy Creative Energizing Euphoria Happy
3830,OG Wreck,"Two famed strains gave birth to this powerful sativa-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of roughly 30:70): OG Kush and Trainwreck. The THC level of OG Wreck is uncertain, as is the CBD level. But it's probably safe to assume this strain is low in the cannabinoid CBD and not a good choice for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to it. The high is almost entirely cerebral, with euphoric energy and a peppy mood boost. It's great for alleviating anxiety and depression, as well as physical fatigue, migraines and other headaches, chronic pain, and inflammation. Bloodshot eyes and cottonmouth are both common, while paranoia is less likely. OG Wreck has a strong, sour skunky odor with hints of pine, nuts, and soil, and tastes like fruit and black pepper. The buds are long and chunky thanks to the plant's OG genes, and they're covered with dense, frosty trichomes so white they almost have a bluish tint. This strain is typically found only in California and British Columbia. It has a devoted following, but their numbers are few and they're nearly as hard to find as OG Wreck itself.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,70% Indica,30% Sativa,16.5,Earthy Sweet Spicy Sour Herbal Fruity Skunky Pine Nutty,Aroused Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing Aroused Euphoria Focus Happy Relaxing
3831,RD-12,"Take the genes of Big Bud, Shiva, and a Hawaiian indica, mix them together, and you've got RD-12, a rare indica-dominant hybrid with an unknown ratio of sativa to indica. This strain is fairly strong, with THC levels of at least 16% in some tests. CBD, meanwhile, is nearly nonexistent, roughly 0.03% in the same tests, so RD-12 shouldn't be used as the sole treatment for epilepsy or other conditions that can be relieved with CBD. The high is almost entirely physical and comes with a pleasant body buzz, calming effects, couch-lock, and sleepiness. That makes this an ideal medical choice for relieving sleeplessness, though it's also helpful with tumors, chronic pain, migraines and other headaches, and inflammation. RD-12 has a sweet taste of earth and wood, while it smells of blueberries and Skunk. Though reports of negative effects are few and far between, that's mostly because this strain is so rare. In any event, dry mouth, dry eyes, and paranoia are typically the most common side effects when smoking marijuana. This strain could conceivably be purchased on the legal markets in California and the rest of the American West, but it's definitely not a common selection.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,16.0,Sweet Blueberry Woody Skunky,Body High Relaxing Body High Relaxing

3922,Tootsie Roll,"Two favorite chocolate strains, Chocolope and Chocolate Thai, were merged to create this sativa-dominant hybrid with an unknown sativa/indica ratio. The bud is multi-colored, with flecks of purple, red, green, and brown, and it smells of sweet chocolate. Tootsie Roll tastes of chocolate and fudge, as its name suggests. It's hard to judge just how potent this strain is, since THC levels aren't widely reported. But its mixed parentage – Chocolope is high in THC and Chocolate Thai isn't – suggests it's a moderately potent medical selection. Reliable data on CBD levels are likewise hard to come by, and that means Tootsie Roll probably shouldn't be used as the only source of cannabis treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD. The effects of this strain are mostly cerebral, with energy, happiness, and calming mental relief. It's a great way to treat anxiety, depression, mood disorders, chronic pain, and everyday stress. Negatives may include dry eyes or dry mouth, though there are few public reports on the subject.

Its popularity has since faded dramatically, but it remains an effective tool for treating muscle spasms and chronic pain. THC levels in this strain reportedly test above 19%, so it's a relatively potent choice for patients seeking a calming, energizing, clear-headed cerebral high that can also be used to treat anxiety and depression. CBD levels are much harder to come by, though Colombian Gold has been used to crossbreed strains that are high in that cannabinoid. Still, without more reliable information, this strain shouldn't be used as the sole medication for conditions that respond to CBD, including seizure disorders. Colombian Gold is a near-pure sativa (sativa/indica ratio of at least 75:25), the result of an original Colombian landrace strain. It delivers a smooth but tangy tea flavor and a Skunky aroma with notes of lemon and lime. The buds are covered in visible crystals.

Yet the THC helps ease pain and other physical symptoms without clouding the mind. This strain is best used to treat severe seizure disorders, chronic pain, and anxiety, though it can also be helpful with patients who experience nausea. Some negative effects are reported, including dry eyes and anxiety, but they appear to be limited. Trident has a pungent pine aroma and an earthy flavor.

The sativa/indica ratio is 60:40, a combination that creates an upbeat, euphoric head high with bursts of energy and creativity.

But it is good at treating anxiety, depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and pain (including migraines). Jillybean has a strong, sweet taste and a smell of oranges and mangoes. It has a shiny, frosted appearance created by a dense layer of trichomes, with flecks of green and gold. The flavor, as the name suggests, is similar to jelly beans. Dry mouth is common, while dry eyes, paranoia, and anxiety are more limited. Jillybean is a great daytime strain, ideal for getting things done and staying positive. The high is bubbly and cerebral, though the indica genes deliver limited body effects. This strain is most readily available on the West Coast, in Michigan, and in Colorado.

Sour Skywalker OG has a dank, pungent smell of earth and lemon, as well as a sour flavor with fruity notes of citrus and lemons. The nugs are dense and forest green with purple hues and a thick layer of trichomes.

The high is largely cerebral, suggesting strong sativa genes, with powerfully upbeat euphoria, relaxation, and creativity. It can treat a wide variety of problems: depression, headaches, lack of appetite, nausea, and insomnia. Negative effects likely include cottonmouth and red eyes. This strain is very highly regarded by those who have tried it, but American patients will have a hard time getting their hands on it without going to Canada in person.

The green buds do more than just relax your body and mind. It is known for offering a sensational cerebral experience which may lead you to question your own sanity. Keeping this in mind, individuals new to smoking cannabis are advised to stay clear of the strain. Even the most experienced of users find it incredibly difficult to stay fully aware of themselves or their surroundings while medicating with the strain. Additionally, the strain can give you the munchies as well which is why it would be a good idea to have some snacks lying around. However, it is worth noting that the strain has several medical applications and can be used for treating insomnia, stress, chronic aches and depression.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,27.0,Earthy Pungent Chemical Diesel Candy Lemon Pine Woody,Euphoria Giggly Happy Relaxing Euphoria Giggly Happy Relaxing

True to its name, King Kong, aka King Kong Kush, is an especially potent indica-dominant hybrid with a sativa/indica ratio of 20:80. The buds, however, are smaller than the name suggests, with a dark green leafy appearance. The flavor is earthy with skunk tones, while the smell is strong and pungent. Solid THC concentrations are hard to come by, as are figures regarding CBD contents in this strain. But it has a reputation as a powerful medical choice with strong, calming body effects and a euphoric boost of happiness. King Kong is best used to relieve symptoms of body pains, insomnia, anxiety, lack of appetite, and severe PMS. Possible side effects include the usual: dry mouth and bloodshot eyes. Headaches and dizziness are also reported but are less common. It's not entirely clear where King Kong comes from, though its mother was apparently an Ed Rosenthal Super Bud plant, itself a strong indica-dominant hybrid.

White Fire – and presumably Raskal's White Fire – is a cross of Fire OG and The White, a pairing that produces a strong diesel smell and a thick coating of resinous crystals on the bud. THC levels are said to be massive in this strain, potentially topping 24%. That concentration should make for an intense but calming, happy, and sociable cerebral high. Raskal's White Fire can be used to relieve anxiety, low mood, and lack of appetite, as it generates powerful hunger. It shouldn't be used as the only source of treatment for seizure conditions, however, as it's low in CBD. Not much is known about this plant, including its aroma, flavor, and appearance, but to judge by the original White Fire, this strain likely has a pungent fuel smell with sweet, earthy tones. Adverse effects could include dry eyes, dry mouth, dizziness, anxiety, and headaches.

But it's a very useful tool for patients looking to relieve the symptoms of anxiety and stress. The high, which hints at this strain's sativa heritage, is euphoric and happy. This strain creates a strong, sour aroma of diesel and a similar flavor with notes of wood. There aren't many reports of side effects, but dry mouth, red eyes, and paranoia are usually among the most common.

4983,Popcorn Kush,"Though its appearance is similar to popcorn, this strain shouldn't be confused for the low-quality ""popcorn"" nugs produced by many marijuana plants. They may be small, but they pack a punch. Popcorn Kush is an indica-dominant hybrid, but the precise ratio of sativa to indica is unclear. This strain has relatively high THC levels, over 17% in some tests. On the other hand, CBD levels are too low to register, meaning Popcorn Kush shouldn't be relied upon as the only treatment for seizures or other problems that respond to that chemical. The flavor is similar to buttered popcorn, with additional notes of grapefruit, blue cheese, and blueberries. The smell, meanwhile, includes sweet hints of berries, cheese, and fruit. The popcorn-shaped nugs are bright green with light green leaves, brown hairs, and crystals. The effects – calming, creative, and happy – are good for treating anxiety, glaucoma, ADHD, and chronic pain, while an intense case of the munchies makes Popcorn Kush an ideal medication for eating and wasting disorders. Likely side effects include dry eyes and cottonmouth, while paranoia, headaches, and dizziness are also reported.

The high comes on hard like a punch to the brain with an almost immediate euphoric lift that immediately diffuses any racing thoughts or mental pains. This sense of complete happiness will start to fade in and out of focus, leaving you easily distracted and out of it mentally. A subtle tingle will slowly start to build in the back of your head before spreading through the rest of your body with warming tendrils, leaving you with a buzzy body high that’s completely relaxing and sedative. This effect can lead many users to fall asleep, especially those who aren’t as experienced with medical cannabis. These potent effects and its high THC level give God’s Bubba the ability to treat conditions such as chronic pain, insomnia, headaches, and appetite loss. God’s Bubba has a classic kush flavor and aroma with hints of dank spicy herbs and earthy pine.

The sativa genes are dominant in this hybrid, which has a sativa/indica ratio of between 60:40 and 70:30. THC levels, which top 16% in available tests, are high enough to deliver effective medical treatment yet low enough to appeal to first-time patients and occasional smokers. Even so, the side effects from this strain can be powerful, especially the paranoia, so patients with anxiety may want to avoid this strain. Still, it's an excellent tool for relieving depression, inflammation, migraine headaches, mood disorders, nausea, pain, and insomnia. It's a less helpful tool in fighting seizures and other conditions that require CBD, since that chemical is scarce in Red Dragon. The high the strain produces is euphoric and happy yet sleepy and powerfully hungry, making it a good tool for alleviating wasting and eating disorders.

The effects of this particular strain have been defined by some as a very pro-active one. What this means is that when smoked, the smoker will feel relatively more active and alive.

This strain has a strong, Skunky aroma and flavor, while the bud is dark green with brown hairs, dense nugs, and a frosty layer of trichome crystals. Side effects may include dry mouth, dry eyes, and paranoia, while dizziness and headaches are also possible.

5071,Big Sur Holy Weed,"The genetics of this sativa-dominant hybrid (70:30 sativa/indica ratio) are obscure, but Big Sur Holy Weed is rumored to be a descendant of Zacatecas Purple, an original Mexican sativa, and Mazar i Sharif, itself a combination of Afghani and Skunk strains. THC test results are hard to come by for this medical strain, but its modest popularity and limited availability suggest it's moderately potent at best. That makes it a good choice for part-time smokers and newcomers. It can be an effective form of treatment for anxiety, low mood, chronic pain, and stress. But because there is little public data on CBD levels in Big Sur Holy Weed, it's not a good choice for patients with seizures or other conditions that require CBD. The rainbow bud of this strain has gold-tinted leaves and orange, red, and yellow hairs. It tastes like sweet licorice and spicy peppers, and it has a sweet, herbal melon aroma. There are few reports of side effects, but cottonmouth and dry eyes are safe bets. Despite its name, Big Sur Holy Wood sells better in Oregon than in California.

This strain is an effective tool in treating low mood, anxiety, nausea, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. It's also a good choice for alleviating eating disorders and wasting conditions, as it induces a powerful case of the munchies. THC levels are on the upper end of modest, at least 15% in publicly available tests, so the effects are certainly noticeable. But CBD levels are much lower, less than 1%, so Black Velvet shouldn't be used as an exclusive treatment for epilepsy or other conditions alleviated by CBD. Red eyes are widely reported as a negative effect of this strain, along with dry mouth and more limited paranoia. Black Velvet isn't especially popular, perhaps in part because of its moderate THC levels, but it can be found in Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, and British Columbia.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,15.0,Pine Citrus Sweet Fruity,Body High Cerebral Euphoria Giggly Happy Hungry Body High Cerebral Euphoria Giggly Happy Hungry

The high is largely cerebral, with creative, euphoric effects, happiness, and a case of the giggles. That belies this strain's true indica-dominant nature (sativa/indica ratio of about 40:60).

5203,Chem Diesel,"Chem Diesel is a sativa strain and it is produced by crossing Sour Diesel and Chem 91. The strain has an astounding 25% THC content, which explains why it is not recommended to those who are new to smoking cannabis. The buds do not look extraordinary, that is for certain. They are dark green and color and have amber hairs making their way out of the greens. The smell is no different from any other diesel strain and the taste is just about the same as well. If you are fan of Sour Diesel, Chem Diesel will not disappoint you and will leave a good aftertaste in your mouth. The strain primarily offers a cerebral high. One thing is for certain: you will exhibit symptoms of couch-lock which is why you should not make any other plans after smoking Chem Diesel. The cannabis strain is extremely potent. A hit is more than enough to make you toasty. Its high will relax and calm you nonetheless and make you feel extremely hungry at the same time.

5206,Cherry Blossom,"This sweet-tasting indica-dominant hybrid is most often found in the Pacific Northwest, where it sells on the medical markets in Oregon and Washington State. It may also be available in California, though it's less common elsewhere. It's not a staple on the black market, either, but may circulate there from time to time. Cherry Blossom is an indica-dominant hybrid with roughly a 30:70 sativa/indica ratio. Its genetics aren't widely known, so it's hard to say exactly what kind of crossbreed this is. It's a highly potent strain, with some sources claiming THC levels as high as 27%, though that's doubtful. CBD levels aren't reported but probably aren't very high. Cherry Blossom is best for treating anxiety, stress, and insomnia, as it delivers a powerful, mellow body high that calms and soothes sore muscles and jagged nerves. It should be saved for late nights, as the high can be sedating. This strain has a sweet cherry flavor to match its name and a sweet aroma. Negative effects are unclear, though like most strains, Cherry Blossom likely causes dry eyes and cottonmouth.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,70% Indica,30% Sativa,27.0,Earthy Sweet Cherry Fruity Berry Pine,Body High Mellow Relaxing Sleepy Body High Mellow Relaxing Sleepy

It is cross between Original Bubblegum Female and an F1 Lavender Male, where 70 per cent of it constitutes of Indica and 30 per cent of Sativa. This particular strain has a fruity flavour and similarly bubble gum aroma, hence its name. This strain is light green and has an icy look. It can be grown indoors and outdoors within the flowering period of eight to ten weeks. Bubblicious has a very high THC level, up to 20 per cent. It has a euphoric effect on the patient and helps in promoting relaxation and serenity. It is mostly used in stress-related disorders, headaches, nausea, anxiety-associated problems, and chronic pain. It induces excitement, calmness, happiness and may even lead to uncontrollable giggles. One disadvantage is that it may cause dehydration of the eyes and mouth. Bubblicious is regarded as the most popularly used medical marijuana strain, with the best composition and most favourable effects for patients.

5210,OG Strawberry,"OG Strawberry, also often called “Strawberry Kush,” is an indica dominant hybrid (85% indica/15% sativa) strain created as a cross between the insanely popular Bruce Banner #3 and SFV OG strains. This powerful bud has posted a THC level of up to 28% and a CBD level that ranges from 1-2% on average. This bud has an aroma of sweet and sour strawberry diesel and a taste of sour diesel with a hint of sweet berry that intensifies upon each exhale. OG Strawberry buds have super dense small to medium-sized pebble-shaped forest green nugs with sparse fiery orange hairs and a frosty layer of thick chunky white trichomes and sweet sticky resin. The OG Strawberry high starts as a mildly uplifting euphoric effect and tingling felt behind the eyes and in the back of the head. This high slowly spreads throughout the body, leaving you lazy and hungry with a warming sensation that can leave you completely aroused. You’ll be talkative and insanely introspective on this bud, making it perfect for social situations. Because of these effects, OG Strawberry is often used to treat patients suffering from conditions such as insomnia, migraines or headaches, muscle spasms, and chronic anxiety.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,85% Indica,15% Sativa,23.0,Earthy Sweet Diesel Sour Tropical Strawberry Berry Pungent,Aroused Creative Euphoria Happy Sleepy Aroused Creative Euphoria Happy Sleepy

5212,Purple Dream,"Blue Dream, a potent even blend of sativa and indica, is one of the most popular marijuana strains of all time. So is Purple Kush, a mightily powerful pure indica (the ratio of sativa to indica is unknown). Together they were used to breed Purple Dream, a mild but effective indica-dominant hybrid. Some sources use this name to describe a different strain, a cross of Blue Dream and Granddaddy Purps, but the Purple Kush cross seems to be more popular. THC levels are apparently low, probably no more than 15-20%, but there's no available information on CBD contents. The taste and smell are both reminiscent of berries, flowers, and pine trees. The bud is dark green with many flecks of dark brown and a light dusting of trichomes. The high is cerebral and euphoric with a mood boost and a creative spark. Use Purple Dream to treat anxiety, mood disorders, depression, ADHD, inflammation, migraine headaches, and muscle spasms. Side effects may include bloodshot eyes and dry mouth, while dizziness, paranoia, and headaches are less likely. Look for this strain in California, Colorado, Washington State, and Arizona.",Hybrid,50% Indica,50% Sativa,17.5,Earthy Sweet Blueberry Grape Fruity Berry,Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Happy
5213,Purple Skunk,"A heavily sativa-dominant hybrid, Purple Skunk is a cross of the ever-popular Skunk #1 and an older, more obscure purps strain. The sativa/indica ratio is roughly 85:15, so expect creative cerebral effects with a strong dose of euphoria, a tingling sensation, and powerful hunger. That makes this a good strain for treating lack of appetite, though it's also effective with anxiety, depression, migraine headaches, chronic pain, insomnia, and daily stresses. Purple Skunk has relatively high THC content, topping at least 18% in tests, and that makes for potent psychoactive effects that may be too strong for newcomers and part-time tokers. CBD levels are likely quite low, given the abundance of THC, but since they're not widely reported, it's hard to know. For that reason alone, Purple Skunk shouldn't be used as a CBD strain for patients whose conditions require that chemical. This strain tastes of berry, earth, and Skunk, while it smells much the same. Reported side effects include watery eyes, cottonmouth, dizziness, headaches, and paranoia. Though popular among those who have tried it, Purple Skunk isn't widespread; it's easiest to find in Washington State, Oregon, Montana, Arizona, and California.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,15% Indica,85% Sativa,18.0,Sweet Grape Berry Skunky Pungent,Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus Creative Energizing Euphoria Focus

5215,Purple Gorilla,"The sativa/indica ratio of this sweet, fruity strain is roughly 40:60, making it a good choice for treating insomnia, pain, migraine headaches, and muscle spasms, among other problems. The exact heredity is something of a mystery, but it probably carries genes that descend from the original Mendocino Purps. Tests suggest this strain has THC content that can top 17%, possibly more, so it's typically quite potent. Unfortunately for patients with seizure disorders and other conditions that are treated with CBD, that cannabinoid appears in this strain in low concentration, less than 1%. The indica parentage sparks a creative, energized high in both the body and the head, together with intense euphoria and happiness. Medical uses include treatment for anxiety, muscle spasms, migraine headaches, nausea, chronic pain, and insomnia. This strain produces a sharp, pungent aroma of earth and berries, together with a similar flavor. Nugs are relatively dark with many amber strands. The medical market in Arizona is the easiest place to find this effective strain, though it's also sold in at least one Oregon dispensary and occasionally makes the rounds on the black market.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,60% Indica,40% Sativa,17.0,Earthy Sweet Grape Spicy Fruity Berry Pungent,Creative Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sleepy Creative Euphoria Happy Relaxing Sleepy
5216,Qrazy Train,"Trainwreck, Trinity, Purple Urkle, and Space Queen were combined to form Qrazy Train, a popular hybrid with a near-even blend of sativa and indica (roughly a 50:50 sativa/indica ratio). Maximum THC levels hover below 16%, so while this strain isn't particularly potent, it's a good choice for patients who are just starting with medical marijuana. But it's not a great selection for those who suffer from seizure disorders or other conditions that can typically be treated with CBD, as that cannabinoid is almost completely absent from Qrazy Train, less than 1%. This strain is an effective pain reliever, and it's also helpful with anxiety, sleeplessness, and depressed mood. The effects are euphoric, happy, and uplifting, and the high may induce laziness and sleep. Dry mouth and dry eyes are almost equally common when smoking Qrazy Train, while dizziness is also reported. Paranoia and headaches are less common. This strain has a fruity smell, with flavors that range from blueberries and melons to Skunk and spice. It has a light, multi-colored appearance, with a light dusting of trichomes on the bud.

5217,Malawi Gold,"Malawi Gold is a 100% pure sativa strain native to the region of Malawi in Africa that is a favorite of breeders and users alike. This classic bud offers a moderate THC level between 9-13% and a mild aroma of banana, as it is traditionally cured wrapped in layers of banana leaves. Malawi Gold is prized among cannabis users for its uplifting clear-headed high that won’t weight you down or leave you feeling anxious or paranoid. This high hits you fast with a crashing wave of cerebral energy that leaves you laser-focused with a sense of motivation and purpose. Because of its moderate THC level, the cerebral effects are not too overpowering and are perfect for any level of cannabis user. Because of these cerebral sativa effects, Malawi Gold is often a choice for treating fatigue, mild cases of depression, chronic stress, and nausea. This bud has pyramid-shaped bright neon green super leafy nugs with red hairs and frosty amber hued trichomes and sweet sticky resin. Malawi Gold has a classic sativa aroma of sweet and spicy fresh herbs with just a hint of banana and an enticing taste of sweet and spicy herbal tea with just a touch of earth upon exhale.",Sativa,,,11.0,Earthy Sweet Spicy Herbal Tea Pungent,Cerebral Energizing Happy Uplifting Cerebral Energizing Happy Uplifting
5218,Six Shooter,"Six Shooter is an evenly balanced hybrid strain (50% indica/50% sativa) created through a potent five-way cross of the infamous Haze X Super Skunk X Northern Lights X Brazilian Royal Dutch X Trainwreck strains. Named for its crazy combination of celebrity strains, Six Shooter brings on a heavy-hitting high that will have you soaring mere moments after your first toke. You’ll feel a euphoric onset at the start of the high accompanied by a tingly sense of cerebral euphoria. This buzziness stimulates the mind, providing a sense of creativity and motivation alongside a building happiness that seems to grow and grow without any ceiling. Thanks to these potent effects and its high 20-25% average THC level, Six Shooter is often recommended for treating those suffering from chronic anxiety or stress, nausea or appetite loss, chronic pain, depression and headaches or migraines. This bud has a super sweet citrusy lemon flavor with a lightly spicy herbal haze exhale. The aroma follows the same pattern, although with hints of pungent skunk and earth to it at times.

5221,Romulan Grapefruit,"This is a hybrid descendant of the popular strains Romulan and Grapefruit. They combine to create a strong indica (sativa/indica ratio unknown) with both mental and physical effects. CBD contents in Romulan Grapefruit are relatively small, probably less than 2%. That means this strain shouldn't be used alone to relieve seizure disorders or other conditions that require CBD treatment. But it can be used effectively as medicine for a wide range of other health problems, such as anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, lack of appetite, nausea, chronic pain, insomnia, and everyday stress. The high is calming and focused, with a mood boost, increased sociability, and physical relaxation, as well as a strong case of the munchies. THC levels are above average, measuring at least 16% in available tests. In other words, this is a good choice for patients looking to cross over from the weaker beginner strains into more potent territory. Dry mouth and paranoia are the most common side effects, though dizziness, red eyes, and headaches are also reported. Romulan Grapefruit, not surprisingly, has a strong aroma and flavor of grapefruit, together with cheese and apples.

5225,Pineapple Trainwreck,"Pineapple Trainwreck is a cross between Shipwreck and Pineapple Express. It is a sativa dominant strain with a 20:80 indica/sativa ratio. By the looks of the strain, it will not look like much, but looks can be deceiving nonetheless. The buds are dense and a bit spongy with a shaggy trim. There are no stand-out features apart from the size itself. As for the smell, you can expect the same great spicy-sour-citrus aroma. However, you will immediately realize that the scent has hints of old tropical fruit as well. All in all, the scent is unique and quite pleasant. Even though Pineapple Express has never managed to impress or live up to its name, Pineapple Trainwreck proves to be exceed expectations. The strain is extremely sweet and cool with an easy non-expansive smoke which is quite rare to come across. The strain has a nice high and will leave your relaxed in a number of minutes. The buzz will energize you making you feel refreshed. You may even get the munchies, which is why it would be a good idea to have some snacks lying around while you smoke the strain.

5228,Outdoor Snow Cap,"Outdoor Snow Cap is the close cousin of Snowcap, a sativa-heavy hybrid that's increasingly popular in the American West. Presumably the ""outdoor"" label means this particular strain is recommended for outdoor cultivation. Outdoor Show Cap is loaded with THC: That cannabinoid makes up as much as 23% of this strain in some tests. CBD levels, though, are very low, less than 1%, which means this strain isn't ideal for treating seizure disorders or other diseases that respond to CBD. The sativa genes dominate in this descendant of an unknown Haze plant, while the limited indica heredity has little effect. The exact sativa/indica ratio, however, is unknown. The high is powerful and head-focused, with creative, clear-headed thinking, energy enhancement, potent euphoria, and a happy case of the giggles. That makes Outdoor Snow Cap best for treating anxiety, depression, fatigue, ADHD, inflammation, mood disorders, and chronic pain. Expect the usual side effects: dry mouth, red eyes, and possibly some paranoia. This strain has a strong, pungent chemical odor similar to ammonia, while it has a distinct lemon flavor.

5232,Platinum Purple Kush,"This heavy, sleepy indica is an ideal nighttime strain and can help treat insomnia. It provides deep body relaxation while maintaining mental focus. The effects are calming, euphoric, and happy, and come with a powerful case of the munchies. This makes it ideal for lack of appetite, as well as anxiety, migraines, headaches, inflammation, muscle spasms, chronic pain, and stress. THC levels are nothing to write home about, hovering around 23% in most available tests. Nor is there much CBD in this strain: less than 1%, and that makes this a less than ideal tool in dealing with seizures or other disorders that require that cannabinoid. Still, it can be a very pleasant choice for patients who have never used marijuana before or who want a mellow, calming experience. Berry, earth, and grape are the dominant notes to the smell and taste of Platinum Purple Kush, while the nugs are large and leafy, light green, and purple with a platinum coating.

5235,Mango Kush,"Mangos and marijuana go together. The fruit is known to enhance the high for many people, and some cannabis strains are bred to evoke the fruit. The taste of Mango Kush, not surprisingly, is similar to mangos and Kush, with notes of pine. It smells of the tropics, sweet mangos, and bananas. THC can make up as much as 16% of this strain, while CBD is much lower, about 0.3%. That makes this a poor choice for treating conditions that respond to CBD, such as severe seizure disorders. Mango Kush is an indica-dominant hybrid (35:65 sativa/indica ratio) that can be used to treat nausea and vomiting, pain, insomnia, lack of appetite, and depression. The high is centered on the body, with deep relaxation, strong euphoria, and a general sedated feeling. Many patients find themselves talking and giggling more than usual while high on this strain. Dry mouth is a common concern, as are bloodshot eyes, but most other adverse effects are limited. While it's most popular on the West Coast, Mango Kush can also be found on the legal medical markets in Arizona and Michigan.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,65% Indica,35% Sativa,15.5,Earthy Mango Sweet Pungent Tropical Fruity Pine,Euphoria Giggly Happy Relaxing Euphoria Giggly Happy Relaxing

5239,Platinum OG,"Platinum OG is a super-potent descendant of OG Kush, Master Kush, and an unknown parent. THC levels easily top 20% and have reportedly reached 24% in some tests. This indica-dominant hybrid has a sativa/indica ratio of 25/75, and that is reflected in the mostly physical high. The powerful effects include a calming body buzz with couch-lock, euphoria, happiness, and intense sleepiness. This makes Platinum OG a good medication for insomnia, as well as anxiety, low mood, ADHD, inflammation, migraine headaches, mood swings, and muscle spasms. CBD levels are very low, less than 1%, which isn't surprising, considering the high THC content. In other words, this strain shouldn't be used as sole treatment for seizures or other disorders that require CBD. Platinum OG produces a smell of diesel, spice, and coffee; the flavor is similar, with additional hints of herb. The bud is lime green and covered in fuzzy trichome hairs. Dry mouth is by far the most commonly cited side effect with this strain, though dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia are also reported.

5240,Lemon Thai Kush,"Lemon Thai Kush is probably better known as simply Lemon Thai; real stoners tend to drop the formal ""Kush."" But the full name indicates just how strong this plant's genes are. This strain likely can trace its ancestry back to the Kush Mountains of Afghanistan by way of Lemon Kush, and also to an original Thai landrace sativa. No one seems to know the exact parentage of Lemon Thai Kush, but the result is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an unclear ratio of sativa to indica. This strain has a sweet lemony taste and an aroma of citrus fruit. The buds are long and have a bright green appearance. The THC and CBD contents are likewise mostly a mystery, at least outside the circles that grow and sell Lemon Thai. Expect a powerfully uplifting head high with euphoria and happiness. The effects are energizing and can spark creativity. Use it to treat anxiety and depression, as well as migraines and body pains. Many patients experience dry mouth and red eyes, while dizziness is also a possibility. Lemon Thai, though popular among those who have smoked it, isn't very common in the United States.

With THC levels that can reach 20%, Trinity delivers a potent head high that can clear away the blues and spur creativity. The euphoric effects are deeply relaxing and upbeat. CBD levels, meanwhile, are uncertain but probably quite low. In other words, Trinity is not a leading choice for conditions that respond to CBD. This strain is especially useful in treating depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as chronic pain and migraines. The limited indica genes also make this a strong option for treating insomnia. Dry mouth is a common adverse effect, as are red eyes, while anxiety and paranoia are also reported. The flavor and aroma are predominantly skunky, with sweet, pungent undertones. Trinity is most often found in Colorado and the Pacific Northwest, but even there it's scarce.

5262,God's Gift,"God's Gift is an indica dominated strain (90:10 indica / sativa ratio) with a staggering 27% THC level. It is the potent offspring of Granddaddy Purple and OG Kush, which should explain its pain-relieving properties. It has an exceptional flavor that most people relish and enjoy, but it tastes quite similar to Granddaddy Purple but with lemon after-tones and a hint of fresh citrus.

Instead, Dream Queen can be used as an effective treatment for fatigue, nausea, stress, and lack of appetite (it induces powerful munchies). There are earthy notes of sage and tar to the flavor, while the aroma is earthy and rubbery. The nugs are light green and amber with a glistening coat of trichomes.

The sativa/indica ratio is roughly 40:60, so this strain delivers a strong, delightful mix of head and body effects, including a deep physical buzz, relaxation, euphoria, mental relief, and cerebral introspection. The combination makes for a very useful tool in treating anxiety, low mood, nausea, chronic pain, and stress. THC levels are hard to peg down, since they vary so widely, but they appear to range between 11% and a whopping 26%. CBD levels, meanwhile, are evidently very low, too low to recommend Sour OG Kush for treating conditions that are alleviated by CBD concentrates, such as severe seizure disorders. This strain has a sweet, tangy flavor and a fruity aroma. The buds are moderately dense with dark green and gold hues, orange and red hairs, and a layer of crystals. Patients should expect typical side effects, most commonly dry mouth and dry eyes, though dizziness and paranoia are also reported.

The cerebral effects encourage creativity, while the indica genes provide a lazy body high. This strain is recommended for chronic pain, anxiety, and depression, as well as other mood disorders and nausea.

The exact ratio of sativa to indica in this strain is unknown, and the same goes for THC and CBD content. Indeed, it's hard to learn much of anything about this decided rarity. But it's probably best used for mood disorders and anxiety. It's not especially recommended for its CBD content, so it doesn't work well on seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD. On the other hand, the THC seems to be plentiful enough to make this an effective medical strain for some patients. Chunky Diesel has a chocolate flavor, with hints of its diesel origins present in both the taste and aroma.

The high it produces is mostly physical, with deeply calming effects and sleepiness balanced with euphoria, mental focus, and a shot of creativity. This strain is said to be relatively potent, but that claim is hard to verify, as there is little public information on THC test results. The same is true of CBD levels, and that alone means Purple Goo shouldn't be used as the only means of alleviating maladies that require CBD preparations. Commonly reported negative side effects include dry mouth, red eyes, paranoia, dizziness, and headaches.

It's a great way to treat depression, anxiety, physical and mental fatigue, and everyday stress.

It's an indica-dominant hybrid, and the sativa/indica ratio is roughly 30:70, though that's a rough estimate. THC data on this strain are difficult to find, so it's impossible to say how powerful it is. The same is true of CBD levels, though the fact that they're obscure suggests Firecracker isn't a great choice for patients with seizure disorders or other conditions that can be treated with CBD. The indica high is body-centric, with a peaceful, calming physical buzz, a boost of happiness, and mental relief. Those effects make this a good too for dealing with chronic physical pain and insomnia. It may also be helpful with depression and anxiety. There aren't many reports of adverse effects when using Firecracker, but red eyes and dry mouth are probably quite common. Paranoia may also be possible. This strain smells and tastes of red wine.

These nugs are dusted with a fine layer of milky white almost amber trichomes and sweet sticky resin. Users describe the Green Apple OG high as having a heavy sativa high. Upon the onset, you'll feel an intense feeling of uplifted euphoria and a burst of creative energy. This is accompanied by an all-encompassing buzz felt primarily behind the eyes and in the forehead and back of the head that leaves you with significant mind relief. The high from smoking Green Apple OG is hugely potent and tends to last hours on end. Due to these effects, this bud is ideal for treating arthritis pain, chronic stress, and fatigue.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,10% Indica,90% Sativa,16.5,Earthy Sugary Sweet Apple Vanilla,Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Uplifting Cerebral Creative Energizing Euphoria Uplifting

5422,Burkle,"Burkle is an indica-dominant hybrid that was created by crossing Granddaddy Purps with Pre-98 Bubba Kush, both strong indicas. It's roughly 75% indica (sativa/indica ratio of 25:75), and that means a high centered on the body. Available tests suggest THC contents of this strain can top 19%, making it one of the more potent medical choices available. CBD is negligible, however, only about 0.2%, so Burkle is not a good choice for alleviating seizures or other problems that respond to CBD. The body high is profoundly calming, a pleasant experience that leaves users relaxed and ready to sleep. Insomnia and pain are among the conditions this strain can treat, though patients with anxiety, depression, or mood disorders may also benefit. With a strong peppermint flavor, Burkle has an aroma of flowers and licorice. The loosely packed buds are flecked with bright green and strands of orange. This isn't a terribly popular strain, either for medical or recreational users, but it can probably be found on the legal markets in the American West. It's even less common on the black market.",Indica Dominant Hybrid,75% Indica,25% Sativa,19.0,Sweet Blueberry Floral Berry Pine,Happy Hungry Relaxing Sleepy Happy Hungry Relaxing Sleepy

5425,Lemon Drop,"Lemon Drop is a sativa dominant strain with a 40:60 indica/sativa ratio. Considering its sativa heritage it still manages to produce a staggering 18% THC content. Upon closer inspection, you will come to realize the buds are green in color and quite fluffy all the while being covered by trichomes. It has a fruity and tangy aroma and tastes just about the same. The name does speak for itself, as it does have an incredible lemony taste to go along with it. That being said, you have to keep in mind that the strain is quite potent. It is not recommended for the faint of heart, which is why beginners are advised to stay clear of Lemon Drop as well. It is the perfect strain for experienced cannabis users and is perfect for daytime use. That being said, it can also be smoked along with other medication. This is quite rare and not the case with other strains where side effects are to be expected. Individuals may feel euphoric and will experience an increase in appetite. The strain on several occasions has been recommended to patients suffering from anxiety, anorexia and even depression. Keeping this in mind, it is no surprise why Lemon Drop has grown immensely popular over the years and will continue to do so for years to come.",Sativa Dominant Hybrid,40% Indica,60% Sativa,18.0,Earthy Grapefruit Citrus Sweet Tropical Dank Lemon,Energizing Euphoria Focus Giggly Happy Hungry Energizing Euphoria Focus Giggly Happy Hungry

5428,Sour Tsunami,"The name of this increasingly popular medical choice refers not to the potency of its high but to the power of its symptom relief. Sour Tsunami has high CBD content, as high as 10% or even 11%, which makes it one of the most seizure-friendly medications on the market. THC levels, on the other hand, are quite low, usually less than 10%. That makes this a good choice for some children with severe epilepsy, as well as other patients whose conditions respond to CBD. A cross of Sour Diesel and NYC Diesel, this strain is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an unknown ratio of sativa to indica. Anyway, the genetic balance of Sour Tsunami is much less important to most patients than its high CBD content. This strain should be used to treat chronic pain, seizures, insomnia, and stress. It can also helps spur appetite in patients who need to eat more. Like its parents, Sour Tsunami has a sour flavor and smell with strong notes of diesel and earth. Though it's popular in California and Michigan, this strain is found mostly in the Pacific Northwest.

5441,Hitman Og,"Hitman OG is a rare indica dominant hybrid strain (80% indica/20% sativa) created through crossing the infamous OG Kush with another high-powered hybrid indica strain. This bud brings on the hard-hitting effects, with a super high 24-29% average THC level and long-lasting hypnotic effects.

5442,Purple Widow,"THC levels are low in this pleasant strain, roughly 13% in some tests. So while it's not perfect for heavy users, Purple Widow can be a great choice for patients who haven't smoked marijuana before. CBD levels, however, are typically very low, less than 1%, meaning this isn't a good strain for patients looking to treat seizure disorders. But it is good at treating several other conditions, including anxiety, depression, lack of appetite, and migraine headaches. This strain is a descendant of Purple Power and the legendary White Widow. An indica-dominant hybrid, it has a sativa/indica ratio of 45:55 and delivers a calming, relaxing body buzz that, while not terribly strong, is enjoyable and effective. Purple Widow has a sweet, fruity aroma and flavor, with specific hints of berry. Like other Purps strains, this one has a deep blue/purple appearance. Adverse effects may include dry mouth and dry eyes, though there's little information on that front.
