Green Dream Strain,"A sativa dominant hybrid, Green Dream is a cross between Blue Dream and Green Crack.

Chemdawg Strain,"With a near-even balance between sativa and indica (sativa/indica ratio of 45/55), Chemdawg, also known as Chemdog, delivers on both fronts. A clear cerebral high drives creativity while a stony, sleepy body high fights insomnia and relaxes the muscles. This strain has THC levels up to 19%, meaning it's more potent than most. It has a powerful spicy, plant-like taste and smell with a hint of diesel; the aroma alone can alert snoopy neighbors to even a carefully concealed pot grow. Not surprisingly, Chemdawg is used to produce Sour Diesel, one of the world's most popular strains. Little is known about Chemdawg's history or genetics, though there are urban legends involving a Grateful Dead concert, a handful of seeds, and a grower named Chemdog. Best for anxiety and pain, this strain is also helpful with depression and ADHD, as well as migraines, arthritis, and PMS. Dry mouth and dry eyes are possible when using this strain, while other side effects are less likely. Chemdawg is most popular on the West Coast, in Nevada, and in Colorado.

Originating in California, this sativa honors the memory of Jack Herer the man, a longtime local cannabis activist and medical marijuana user. It's not quite as strong as its popularity might suggest, but the high is heady and distinctive. Jack Herer has a unique loamy smell and taste with hints of pine and trees.

Lemon Skunk Strain,"With THC levels that reach 22% in some tests, this is a very potent sativa-heavy hybrid. Lemon Skunk, which has a sativa/indica ratio of 60:40, is the award-winning descendant of two distinct Skunk phenotypes that were selected specifically for their tangy lemon traits.

The sativa genes offer effective treatment for depression, nausea, chronic pain, and everyday stresses. CBD levels are a bit higher than average in this strain, roughly 0.5% in some tests, but not high enough to recommend it as treatment for conditions that respond to CBD, such as epilepsy. Dry mouth and watery eyes are the only widely reported negative effects of Lemon Skunk, though paranoia, anxiety, and dizziness are also possible. Found up and down the West Coast, this strain is also popular in Colorado. It occasionally circulates on the black market, as well."
Girl Scout Cookies Strain,"Girl Scout Cookies is an indica-dominant hybrid with a strong sativa component (40:60 sativa/indica ratio).

Cherry Pie Strain,"Cherry Pie is a indica dominant hybrid of Grand Daddy Purp and Duban Poison. Although it is hard to find the authentic version of this particular medical marijuana strain, it definitely will not be hard to believe that this is the best type of strain. In structural composition, it has dense buds with orange hair all over and displays a slight tint of purple. Inspiring the name of this medical marijuana strain, the aroma is that of cherry pies. It is most commonly used by patients who are suffering from evident symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, migraines and other stress-oriented syndromes. Although it may cause dry eyes and mouth upon use by the patient, it definitely helps in elevating the level of euphoria, relaxing body and mind, uplifting moods and focusing the conscience. For patients who are specially looking for something that would ease muscle stiffness and related ailments, this can definitely prove its rescuing ability. Conclusively, this is the best kind of medically favorable marijuana strain that patients prefer above all others; it diminishes the above mentioned syndromes in the most relaxing order and even though sedation may cause irritation, but its value is still undeniable."
Banana OG Strain,The smell of banana peels and Christmas pine trees is what you get with Banana OG. The taste is also like bananas and some people report a cinnamon taste. This is an Indica dominant cross 70:30 Indica/Sativa hybrid between Banana X
Sour Diesel Strain,"Sour Diesel, otherwise known as ""Sour D"" or ""Sour Deez"" is a sativa dominant hybrid strain with a 90:10 sativa/indica ratio. The origin of Sour Diesel is frequently debated within the marijuana community. Some say it's a cross between mass super skunk and 91 Chemdog, while others claim that it's a cross between Mexican sativa and a Chemdog phenotype. Either way, you can undoubtedly look forward to a high like no other. Couch lock and a ""heavy feeling"" aren't a factor when smoking sour diesel. Instead, you can expect an invigorating cerebral high that open up doors of creativity. This strain is commonly used amongst medical patients to relieve anxiety, depression, and chronic fatigue. Although sour diesel consists of some indicia, it's not the best strain for insomnia and other similar ailments because of the stimulating and lively head high that it delivers. Due to the effervescent contained within this strain, many people choose to smoke sour diesel at the beginning of their day for a head start. The potency of this strain is just enough to give you a great high and become your daily toke. The word ""diesel"" in sour diesel didn't come out of absolutely nowhere. This strain has one of the most pungent aromas of any strain, similar to Diesel Gas with a hint of lemon. You can expect a smooth toke with a slight lemon aftertaste. The appearance of sour diesel is composed of dense light green mug covered in orange hairs."
Vanilla Kush Strain,"This appropriately named Dutch strain has THC levels that can reach upwards of 20%, making for a relaxed body high that can be too powerful for some new users. Experienced tokers, however, can usually summon enough energy to be active despite the high. Euphoria and happiness are also common with Vanilla Kush. This strain is good for mental conditions and arthritis pain. Not surprisingly, it tastes and smells of vanilla, with sweet lavender notes. The bud has a light green appearance that is also reminiscent of vanilla. Dry mouth is likely, though other adverse affects are mild. Vanilla Kush is mostly indica (30:70 sativa/indica ratio), and it descends from a Kashmiri Hash Plant and an Afghani Kush. It's most popular in Colorado and Oregon, though it can be found elsewhere. Vanilla Kush is easy to cultivate, making it an ideal choice for patients who grow at home, and it produces a high yield. Due to its powerful high, newcomers and occasional smokers might do well to avoid this strain. But it's perfect for anyone in search of a nice, soothing body high."
Sonic Screwdriver Strain,Sonic Screwdriver is a sativa dominant hybrid (75% sativa/25% indica) strain created through a cross of the powerfully delicious
Grapefruit Strain,"Grapefruit is a longtime marijuana classic, a heady blend of the hybrid Cinderella 99 and a sativa bred specifically for its grapefruit flavor. With a sativa/indica ratio of 70:30, this strain packs a decidedly cerebral punch, with a major mood boost and intense euphoria. THC levels have been charted at 20%, so this is a pretty powerful strain. CBD levels, meanwhile, are very low, ruling this out as an effective treatment for epilepsy. But it's highly effective at relieving anxiety and depression, as well as pain, GI distress, and PMS. The sweet taste and smell of grapefruit are dominant, thought there are also hints of other citrus fruits. Adverse effects are usually quite limited, though dry mouth and red eyes are possible. Dizziness and paranoia are more rare. Grapefruit is common across the country, sold largely on the basis of its unique flavor and aroma. It's most popular in Colorado and on the West Coast, though it can also be found in other legal markets and the black market. This strain is highly appealing to smokers looking for a strong head high, less so to patients seeking physical effects."
Destroyer Strain,"Destroyer is a rare 100% pure sativa strain created through crossing a Meao Thai with a Mexican/Colombian cross. This bud gets its name from its bad mood destroying effects that take on mental aches and pains with ease. Destroyer smashes into your mind with a vengeance after your first few hits, launching you into giddy euphoria with an increase in energy to go with it. You’ll feel a lifted sense of artistic inspiration that’s slightly unfocused at times. As your mind fades in and out of pure hazy bliss, you may start to experience colorful psychoactive effects, which can prove to be too much for those users who suffer from anxiety or paranoia. Thanks to these effects and its moderate 10-15% average THC level, Destroyer is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as depression, cramps or muscle spasms, chronic fatigue, insomnia, and chronic stress. This bud has a sweet and spicy fruity flavor with a citrusy exhale. The aroma is very fruity and spicy with a rich floral overtone that’s pretty light and earthy. Destroyer buds have fluffy spade-shaped minty green nugs with dark orange hairs and a coating of tiny amber crystal trichomes."
Ace of Spades Strain,"The ace of spades may be the death card, but the marijuana strain that bears its name is anything but. Instead, it offers health and healing, especially for patients who suffer from depression, anxiety, multiple sclerosis and muscle spasms, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. Ace of Spades is an indica-dominant hybrid with a sativa/indica ratio of no more than 30:70. The high affects both body and mind, but this strain leans toward the physical. Expect a deep relaxed feeling in the muscles, strong euphoria, a burst of creativity, and a giggly, happy sensation. Ace of Spades is a cross of Black Cherry and"
Blue Dream Strain,Blue Dream is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid (60% sativa/40% indica) strain that is a potent cross between the hugely popular
Northern Lights Strain,"Few strains come with as much widespread renown as Northern Lights, inarguably one of the most popular strains of all time. An inbred descendant of original Afghani landrace strains, Northern Lights is a pure indica. THC levels can reach 16-21%, making this one of the most potent strains available on any market. A couple hits is all it takes for most patient's seeking this strain's powerful body effects, an upbeat mix of euphoria and physical relaxation. CBD levels are less clear, but they certainly aren't high enough to recommend this as a treatment for seizures or other conditions that respond to CBD. Even so, Northern Lights is a highly useful medical strain, effective at treating anxiety, pain, and insomnia, as well as lack of appetite. Cottonmouth is common, as are red eyes, while other negative effects are much more limited. This strain has a sweet, earthy flavor with hints of citrus. Northern Lights is most popular on the West Coast and in Colorado, but it's a favorite pretty much everywhere else marijuana can be found."
Gorilla Glue #4 Strain,"Gorilla Glue #4 is a very potent strain of cannabis, mainly grown in Colorado. The genetic makeup is a mix of Chocolate Diesel with Sour Dub and Chem Sister. The smell of diesel is strong but the taste is similar to coffee that has gone stale. The smell is extremely strong, one of the strongest strains. This is why it is mainly grown indoors. The THC level is about 25-28%. This marijuana plant is light green in color. When it is ready to be harvested, the leaves look like they have snow or salt on them. They offer a high yield of THC.

Laughing Buddha Strain,"Laughing Buddha is a 2003 High Times Cannabis Cup award-winning sativa dominant strain, which is primarily a cross between Jamaican and Thai weed strains. Not only is it an award winning strain, but it is quite different from various other strains you may have already come across before. With THC content around 18%, it has a fruity and sweet smell with hints of spice. The smell is quite noticeable but is equally strong and fresh. However, you have to keep in mind that the nuggets are quite hard. The nuggets are dark green and brownish in color with a thick coating of crystals.

0-0-Swerdlow Strain,"Lanny Swerdlow is a certified nurse and longtime cannabis activist in Southern California's Inland Empire. For several years he ran one of the biggest pot shops in Riverside, Cal., until the city forced him to close up shop. The marijuana strain that bears his name is a pure sativa (100:0 sativa/indica ratio) with a strong sweet flavor and aroma. As a sativa, it has low CBD levels, too low for use in treating symptoms that respond to that chemical. THC levels are unclear. But o-o-Swerdlow is known to produce a strong heady effect, with a blend of energy and relaxation. The high is very happy, with mental relief and a strong case of the munchies. This strain can be used to treat anxiety, depression, irritability, lack of appetite, nausea, and GI distress. Negative effects are likely typical for a sativa, with dry mouth and red eyes possible. Swerdlow the strain, like Swerdlow the man, flies mostly below the radar. It's probably most common in California, where Swerdlow operates, but it's hard to find almost everywhere else, including the black market."
Citrus Farmer Strain,Citrus Farmer is a sativa dominant hybrid strain created through crossing the potent
White Rhino Strain,"White Rhino is a potent Indica strain, and is easily recognizable with its short to bushy, light green to dark green leaves. The nugs are a hue best described as being silvery white and it is well known for its potency, which comes with a high that is hard and fast, mostly due to the high THC content which ranges from 14-20%. With its background of White Widow and a North American Sativa plant, it's also known for its powerful aroma, which is a mix of an earthy, bitter, and would like to smell. It's perfectly common to experience feelings of laziness, happiness, and euphoria after smoking this strain of weed, which is why it's primarily used in the medical world to treat stress, pain, and insomnia. The primary negative effect of this strain is dry mouth, although dry eyes is a possibility. This strain is also known for being particularly durable, being able to be grown in extreme climates."

Blueberry Diesel Strain,"The CBD content in this indica-heavy hybrid (40:60 sativa/indica ratio) is a bit higher than average, but not high enough to recommend it for seizure disorders or other conditions best treated with CBD. THC content, on the other hand, is relatively high, about 15%, making for a peppy but soothing high. The effects are deeply relaxing, with a healthy boost of euphoria. Blueberry Diesel is perfect for moments when creativity is needed, and it makes for a lovely daytime choice.

101 Headband Strain,101 Headband is a slightly indica dominant (60% indica/40% sativa) hybrid strain crated through crossing the infamous
High Mids Strain,"High Mids is a 100% pure sativa hybrid strain with unknown genetics due to how loosely the term is used among cannabis growers. The term ""high mids"" is often used among the cannabis community as a way to refer to strains that are on the border between mid-level strains and top shelf strains. Because of this, the High Mids strain is often confused with the general term ""high mids"" among many cannabis users. This dank bud boasts a moderate THC level ranging from 14-17% on average and a myriad of primarily sativa effects. Users describe the High Mids high as one that is hugely uplifting with a potent head rush and an almost overwhelming burst of creative energy. This is accompanied by an intense case of the munchies and mild couch lock with a sense of ease. Upon the come down, you'll be hit with a powerful crash that leaves you completely sedated.

These buds have medium-sized dense dark olive green nugs with a spattering of dark red and orange hairs as well as thick chunky trichomes."
Trainwreck Strain,"Trainwreck didn't get its name or claim to fame in the marijuana community for no reason at all. This exhilarating hybrid strain has mind blowing components that will hit you like a train after just a couple of hits. A combination of 2 sativas (Mexican and Thai) and one indica (Afghani), this strain is nothing short of a mental roller coaster ride. Although Trainwreck is mainly sativa dominant (80:20 sativa/indica ratio), you can expect a mellowing body high in addition to a cognitive high that administers imaginative and inventive thoughts. Patients commonly use Trainwreck to relieve pain, PTSD and stress. You can smoke this strain comfortably throughout the day even with its super high potency.

Chemical Weapons Strain,Chemical Weapons is an indica dominant hybrid strain (80% indica/20% sativa) created through a potent cross of the classic
Paris OG Strain,"Paris OG is a relatively rare medical strain, though it can be found in at least one Southern California medical marijuana dispensaries. It's an indica-heavy strain, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica isn't widely known. THC levels are said to be fierce, surpassing 19% in some tests, while CBD levels are considerably lower, less than 1%. That's much too low to recommend Paris OG as treatment for epileptics or other patients whose conditions require CBD. Instead, this strain is a useful means of treating depression, glaucoma and eye pressure, headaches, muscle spasms, and nausea. The full, heavy body high is calming and sleepy, so Paris OG is also good for insomnia, and it induces euphoria, happiness, and a tingly sensation. Expect a woody diesel smell with hints of flowers and pine needles, matched with a flavor of flowers, citrus, and pine. The nugs are huge and sticky. Negatives aren't commonly reported, but dry mouth and red eyes are usually the most likely. Though its name suggests French roots, Paris OG sells best in the American Southwest and Michigan."

Opium Strain,"Opium is an evenly balanced hybrid (50% sativa/50% indica) strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy. This bud was the 2nd Place Winner at the 2008 High Times’ Cannabis Cup and boasts a THC level of up to 18% on average. This award winning bud is characterized by an extremely uplifted cerebral high felt behind the eyes and in the forehead without the crash typical of a strong sativa.

Pineapple Express Strain,"Pineapple Express is a Sativa dominant strain with a 60:40 sativa/indica ratio. The strain is quite popular and has achieved recognition thanks to the stoner film of the same name.

But Pineapple Express still manages to offer a mild and nice body-numbing buzz, which is something to look forward to. The strain is offered in the form of well-weighed nuggets that look like Styrofoam popcorn. It does not taste sweet, but it does smell funky with its citrus overtones. The taste is quite extraordinary with a hint of pineapple while you inhale. Pineapple Express is chosen to treat a lot of medical problems including anxiety and stress. However, it is even more effective at curing the symptoms of chronic depression at the same time. If you are suffering from mild pains and aches, you should look no further. After a smoke, you will realize Pineapple Express is calming and stimulating at the same time. Not only will it heighten all your senses but you will feel energized all the while observing an increase in focus, awareness and creativity."
THC Bomb Strain,"Don't let the name fool you: THC levels are definitely strong in this strain, higher than 20% in some cases, but THC Bomb doesn't exactly deliver an explosion. In reality, it's a useful but not exceedingly potent medical choice, name notwithstanding. Use this strain to treat anxiety, stress, chronic pain, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and sleeplessness. The indica-dominant effects (sativa/indica ratio unclear) are perfect for late nights or rainy days – calming and sleepy but also happy and hungry. That makes THC Bomb an effective strain for alleviating clinical lack of appetite. It isn't such a good choice for patients who need CBD to treat seizures or other conditions, as this strain definitely isn't known for its CBD levels. They're not widely reported, and that alone recommends against this strain as a source of this chemical. THC Bomb has an earthy, Skunky taste and smell, with an additional sour flavor. The nugs are loose and green with orange hairs. The most likely side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, red eyes, headaches, and paranoia. THC Bomb can be found in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and Colorado. It's popular enough that it's not hard to find in most places, including the black market."

This allows you to fall into a desired state of laziness. It can also make you euphoric and lazy which means it is perfect for a lazy day off.

Sour OG Strain,"The Sour OG marijuana strain is a hybrid and a cross between OG Kush, Blueberry and Sour Diesel with a 50:50 sativa/indica ratio that creates an impressive 17% THC level. Its buds are not only large, but are dense as well. Additionally, they are covered in trichomes. What is really amazing about the Sour OG is that it looks frosty and is covered by gleaming crystals. However, you have to keep in mind it has an average flower time of eight to nine weeks. Since it has a medium yield, it is grown using simple hydroponics. That being said, its taste is unlike anything you may have come across before. It is earthy with a hint of citrus and offers an amazing high within a matter of minutes. You will feel relaxed and peaceful all the while being in a good mood. Rest assured you will not have to worry about feeling drained out. You will feel productive and will be willing to get things done. You will remain in a positive state while feeling wonderful. Considering how quickly the high comes into effect, it lasts intensely for an hour and even more until it starts to wind down."

As you break apart each little nugget, aromas of earthy blueberries and grapes are released accented by a sweet herbal overtone. The flavor is very sweet with a vanilla blueberry taste that has a touch of slightly sour grape candy."
Flo Strain,"Flo is the distinctive variation of a hybrid strain of medical marijuana. This has been rated #1 in the 'Cannabis Cup' of the year 1996. This strain was created by crossing Purple Thai with Afghani Indica. This medical marijuana strain got its nickname for its remarkable ability to harvest numerous times. Also, this strain is considered to be one among the high yielding plants. The sativa/indica ratio of this strain is found to be 60:40. The THC levels of this strain have been calculated up to 14%, while the CBD is 0.26%. This strain appears to be pear-shaped with a huge number of purple-colored calyxes. The aroma produced by this strain will be sweet and sour like that is being produced from a lemon. This would taste light as well as lemony without any souring and the flavor would be more or less like a lemon drop. This has been found to be an effective alternative therapy for the conditions like pain, anxiety disorders, stress disorders, muscle spasms, loss of appetite and insomnia. This does not mean that the strain can be effective in treating the aforementioned conditions only. The effects of Flo are indicated as mild and energetic."

Cannatonic Strain,"This strain is an even blend of sativa and indica (50:50 sativa/indica ratio). It's a great medical strain high in CBD, a chemical used to treat severe seizures and other conditions. But it's very low in THC 7–15% at most – so Cannatonic isn't a good bet for getting high, despite its name. The high, such as it is, is relaxed and uplifting with both mental and physical qualities. Cannatonic has an earthy smell, with a woody citrus flavor. It's most popular in the Pacific Northwest, California, and Michigan. This strain is best for treating epilepsy and pain, as it provides a deep feeling of relaxation with uplifting cerebral effects. Cannatonic is a hybrid blend of MK Ultra, an indica, and the legendary G-13 Haze, an indica-dominant hybrid.

It's a Washington original, grown by at least two local cultivators, Olympia Mike and A Green Cure. It's a blend of Lemon Skunk and Super Silver Haze, and it has a sativa/indica ratio of 80:20. That means heady, peppy, cerebral effects: arousal, creativity, energy, euphoria, and intense happiness. These make for ideal tools in treating depression, fatigue, anxiety, nausea, and chronic pain. THC levels soar in this strain, with at least one sample topping 25%, and that puts Super Lemon Haze near the top of the potency pyramid. But it isn't known for its CBD levels, which regularly test well below 1%. In other words, this strain shouldn't be used as the only medicine for conditions that respond to CBD, such as seizure disorders. Super Lemon Haze has a tart, zesty lemon flavor and aroma, with sweet notes of candy. The bud, which has a speckled green-and-brown appearance, is covered with a dense layer of resinous trichomes. This strain is popular on the West Coast of the United States and in British Columbia."
Amnesia Haze Strain,This sativa-dominant hybrid is a descendant of a
Chronic Strain,"Being a living legend among rappers and regulars, it's no wonder that Chronic is mentioned as one of the most classical strains of weed ever known to exist. This is typically long and elongated in appearance, with somewhat puffed buds on the taller plants, and has light green, dark green, and specks of gold woven throughout. It is a 80/20 indica dominant hybrid. Chronic originated by a cross between Northern Light X, Skunk X, and AK47 marijuana strains. It is particularly useful medically for aiding in pain relief, relieving the symptoms of depression, anxiety, loss of appetite, and other similar types of conditions. The only downsides reported to this strain are the commonly present combination of cotton eye and dry mouth. Chronic is as versatile as it is beautiful, and no matter in which form you choose to partake of this hybrid strain, it retains its potency and smoothness."
Blueberry Strain,"Blueberry is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain with unknown true parentage.

Dakini Kush Strain,"Dakini Kush is a rare indica dominant hybrid strain created through crossing the classic Pre-98 Bubba Kush wit the infamous Hindu Kush. The celebrity child is a concentrate favorite, although it can be found in bud form as well. Dakini Kush buds have forest green spade-shaped fluffy nugs with bright orange hairs and a dusty coating of tiny greenish amber crystal trichomes. As each sparkling nug is broken apart, rich aromas of berry candy and sweet caramel are released, complemented by herbs and earth as the nugs are burned. The flavor is very sweet with a caramel berry overtone accented by a touch of hops on each savory exhale. The Dakini Kush high comes quickly after your first few tokes, infusing your mind with a building sense of happiness as your body starts to fade into deep relaxation. This sense of calming relaxation will soon become a warming body high, tickling your limbs with sedative effects that pull you down into a pain-free and blissfully numb state. You’ll soon become sleepy in this heavy state, often resulting in a peaceful catnap. Thanks to these effects and its high 20-21% average THC level, Dakini Kush is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as chronic pain, mood swings, depression, chronic fatigue, and muscle spasms."

Tutankhamen has a sweet fruity taste of citrus and earth with a slightly skunky aftertaste that becomes pungent upon exhale. The aroma is surprisingly delicate, with a rich floral earthy smell that has only a hint of sweetness to it. Tutankhamen buds have large oversized Christmas-tree shaped forest green nugs with dark olive green leaves, thick purple hairs, and a super sticky layer of visible sweet resin. The Tutankhamen high is characterized by a stoney introspective cerebral state. You’ll be hit with an immediate onset of a cerebral head rush that numbs the mind and leaves you hazy and distant. A numbing body high will slowly overtake you, leaving you completely relaxed and helplessly couch-locked with a deep sense of spacey introspection. These effects and its insanely high THC level make Tutankhamen perfect for treating chronic pain, mild to moderate cases of depression, chronic stress or anxiety, and chronic fatigue."

Purple Chemdawg Strain,Purple Chemdawg is an indica dominant hybrid (75% indica/25% sativa) strain that is a potent cross between the insanely popular
Pineapple Chunk Strain,"The pineapple chunk strain is another unique, mostly indica based hybrid. Two of its most dominant characteristics include a quick buzz and a heavy effect. With its high THC levels (almost 26%) coupled with a 1.1% CBD level, the experience of smoking this is rewarding to say the least. A heavy effect basically means a very stoned effect which means that this should not be used in a social event. The most obvious medical use of this strain is for treating patients with chronic pain and severe depression. Some smokers report an overwhelming sensation of cerebral energy thus this strain is not recommended for people suffering from sleeplessness. There is an obvious earthy/cheesy stink along with a secondary pineapple smell (which is perhaps where it gets the name from). The smoke, however, has an amazing mouth feel. The smoke is silky smooth and it tastes like, you guessed it, pineapples. There are underpinning earthy flavors but the delicious pineapple taste overpowers it. In terms of appearances this strain is mostly a normal green with some purple hues here and there."

The strawberry components are very distinct in the appearance and taste of this strain. Although the buds from this strain's plant can be quite small, they are also very potent. The buds are dense and covered in red hairs and dewy trichomes, similar to the fruit it's named after."
Galaxy Strain,"The return of this strain of marijuana has come as a surprise for many. Galaxy is a hybrid of Northern Light and Afghani. It is an sativa dominant marijuana strain and is extremely productive with dense buds comprised of resins. Primarily, the buds are large and full of crystals. The branches of Galaxy are fast growing; however they tend to thin out as they need to hold the weight of the buds. Same is the case with Wembley, hence it is recommended that the branches are held tight so they do not break. Galaxy is 80% Sativa and 20% Indica. Typically, Galaxy grows 110-130cm in height and its flowers blossom fully in a time period of 55-60 days. Galaxy is usually harvested in September. Galaxy carries a sweet but strong original taste with hints of pine. This variety of marijuana strain has an odor of forest and pine with strong characteristics of skunk. With a THC content of 17 percent and a CBD level of 2.8 percent, Galaxy provides with a very strong and lasting effect.

Since Galaxy leads to immediate and intense effects, it is increasingly used for patients dealing with anxiety."
Grape Ape Strain,"Grape Ape is a mostly indica crossbreed of Mendocino Purps, Skunk, and original Afghani.

Like its Purple ancestors, this strain develops a deep purple bud and leaves to go with its grape-like qualities. It's most useful in treating chronic pain, including migraines and arthritis, though it also helps relieve anxiety, depression, and PTSD. The high is profoundly relaxing, a full-body experience that can lead to strong couch-lock and deep sleep. This is definitely a nighttime strain, as it can have a near-comatose effect. But the high can also be euphoric and focused, with a clear mind. Dry mouth is common, as are red eyes. Most easily found on the West Coast, in Colorado, and in Michigan, this popular strain can also be purchased across the country, on both legal and black markets. It's a relatively easy strain to grow."

Hell's Angel OG Strain,"The strain is produced by crossing Blackberry and OG Kush. Hell's Angel OG is an indica dominant hybrid strain with an 80:20 indica/sativa ratio. The strain has a THC content that exceeds 20% and it produces amazing buds for cannabis users to medicate with. The buds may be rough around the edges but they are dense. The nuggets are medium-sized and are dark lime green in color. Additionally, they are frosty and have tiny orange hairs seeping through the surface. As for the taste and smell, it delivers a blend of sour, piney and citrus flavors that linger in the mouth for longer than you may expect. The strain and its effects are not aggressive. It is elevating to say the least. You will feel happy and euphoric due to its body stone which later transforms into a cerebral buzz. However, the high is not to be underestimated as it is super strong. Individuals new to smoking cannabis are advised to stay clear of Hell's Angel OG. But that is not all, as the strain is known for its relaxing and calming effects which can at times make you exhibit symptoms of couch-lock.

THC levels are high, topping 21% in some tests. CBD values are very low, less than 1%, making this a poor choice for patients who suffer from epilepsy or other conditions that respond to this cannabinoid.

Platinum Kush Strain,"The sedating high from this indica is perfect for a night of anxiety-free relaxation. Platinum Kush gets its name from its frosty appearance, a result of the dense trichomes that grow on the bud. THC levels vary, but are usually in the 16%-18% range. That makes this a moderately strong choice, though poor growing can lead to very low THC levels. An indica, Platinum Kush has more CBD than most strains available in America. This chemical is used to treat severe seizures and other conditions. The combination of THC and CBD makes this a good strain for anxiety, depression, and pain, as the body high is deeply relaxing. This strain has a sweet, pungent smell reminiscent of fruit and a sweet, earthy taste. Platinum Kush, aka Platinum OG Kush and Platinum OG, is probably the result of crossbreeding between Master Kush and an original Afghani strain. Platinum Kush produces a mellow, easy feeling; the high doesn't last very long, but it's usually enough to put an insomniac to sleep. Dry mouth and red eyes are the only likely adverse effects, though paranoia is also possible. Platinum Kush is most popular in Denver and the West Coast, but it's harder to find in other parts of the country."

The strain offers a high unlike any other you may have encountered before. The high starts from the head, gradually overwhelming your body.

Mandarin OG Strain,"Mandarin OG, also known as “Mandarin Kush,” is a slightly indica dominant hybrid (60% indica/40% sativa) strain created through crossing the classic"
Cherry Kush Strain,"Cherry Kush, also known as Cherry Pie, is an indica-dominant hybrid strain with a sativa/indica ratio of 30:70. That makes for a body high ideal for late nights and insomnia. With THC levels reaching 20%, this is a potent strain with strong medical effects. It's best for treating sleep disorders, migraines, minor body pains, and chronic stress. It's also effective at treating nausea and lack of appetite. CBD levels are much lower, about 0.5%, so this strain isn't recommended for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD. Cherry Kush is a descendant of OG Kush and a Purple Afghani, both indicas. It's used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and nausea, as well as lack of appetite and chronic pain. The Cherry Kush high is body-focused, with strong couch-lock and deep relaxation. It's strongly euphoric and induces sleep. Side effects include dry mouth, dry eyes, and strong hunger. The buds are bright green and frosted with a dense layer of trichomes. This strain has a sweet, pungent flavor with hints of berry. Cherry Kush is widely popular across the United States, though it's easiest to find in legal markets on the West Coast."
Bruce Banner Strain,"This homage to the comic book legend could turn even the Incredible Hulk into a mild-mannered everyman. It's powerfully relaxing, with sativa-dominant genes (60:40 sativa/indica ratio) that deliver a massive dose of THC: Nearly 29% in some tests. That makes this a holy grail of sorts for patients seeking the strongest high. CBD contents, however, are low, so this is not an ideal choice for conditions that respond to that chemical. The head high is intensely euphoric, combined with strong creativity and a whole-body mood boost. Energy levels are high, making this a good daytime strain. Bruce Banner is a highly effective painkiller, but it's also good for anxiety, depression, nausea, and sleeplessness. Dry mouth and bloodshot eyes are both common side effects, along with occasional paranoia and dizziness. The dominant flavor is sweet, with notes of citrus and a strong, pungent smell. The bud has a heavily frosted appearance due to a thick layer of resinous glands. It's most popular in Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon, though it can be found elsewhere. Expect this strain to increase in popularity thanks to its high THC concentrations."
Golden Goat Strain,"Golden Goat which was created 'accidentally' is a sativa dominant hybrid strain of medical marijuana. This was created in Topeka, KS when the male Hawaiian Romulan happened to pollinate the female plant of Island Sweet Sunk. Golden Goat is known for its bright green samples with pink colored pistils. The strain appears to be small golden pieces that are dense and coated in a sheet of adhesive resinous crystals. This is one among the sativa dominant strains with THC level and CBD of 23% and 1.07% respectively. The aroma of Golden Goat will be like the combination of spicy and sweet tropical fruits. This particular strain is attributed as effective in treating a host of chronic conditions like stress, insomnia, anxiety, depression and pain. Although this strain is identified as an effective alternative therapy for these conditions, the number of treatable conditions is not restricted to only these. The effects of this particular strain are extremely strong and can be felt all over the body. And, the effects would last up to 1-2 hours. This would be a good strain to take for breakfast."
Mr. Nice Strain,"This medical marijuana strain which is otherwise called as 'Mr. Nice Guy' is an indica-dominant strain created by Sensi Seeds. This strain is the second prize winner of the '2004 High Life Cup'. This was created by crossing Government-13 (G-13) strain with the Hash Plant. This strain is named in honor of 'Howard Marks', the Oxford graduate who became a folk legend by writing his autobiography in the title 'Mr. Nice' which tells the narrative of his own life as one of the biggest smugglers of Marijuana. The indica/sativa ratio of this strain is 80:20 and THC is ranging between 13 to 19%. The plant is dark green colored with bigger purple leaves covered in orange and white colored hairs running all over the buds. This strain has a fruity aroma which is described as walking through an orchid. The taste of this strain is also fruity and sweet. Mr. Nice strain is recommended to be used during the latter part of the day or at night for easing out severe aches/pains. It can also be utilized in the evening for relieving stress, depression and anxiety."
Grand Daddy Purple Strain,"Grand Daddy Purple is an indica dominant strain and is a cross between Big Bud and Purple Urkle. This blend explains why it has a complex berry and grape aroma while its nugs are oversized with a compact bud structure. The nugs are incredibly dense and fuzzy with deep purple hues that run throughout the buds. Additionally, the nugs are covered by orange hairs and contrast well with its resin-coated buds. What really sets this strain apart from the others is that it is easy to identify by the taste alone. Its taste lingers on the tongue for longer and will help you feel relaxed. The strain has a serious kick to it and its psychoactive effects are evidently detectable in both body and mind. It manages to deliver an overwhelming feeling of physical relaxation and cerebral euphoria. You will find yourself fixed in one spot while your thoughts float in a dreamy buzz for the duration of Grand Daddy Purple's effects. Just like any other indica dominant strain, it is primarily used for medical uses. The strain is quite effective for patients suffering from appetite loss, pain, insomnia, muscle spasms and stress."
Blackberry Kush Strain,"Blackberry Kush is an indica strain. The strain is incredibly potent, especially considering its 20% THC content offering an amazing high. The buds are dense, covered by trichomes and red hairs. However, you will notice hues of yellow, purples and blacks laced throughout the vivid buds. On the other hand, it has a very strong Kush aroma that is smooth-sweet and heady. But it is not as pungent as you would expect it to be. As for the taste, it tastes a lot like it smells. There is a pretty good reason why it is known as Blackberry Kush, it does have a berry taste to it after all. What is really amazing about Blackberry Kush is that you will require very little of it to get the high you want. However, smoking too much of the strain will make you sleep in no time. This explains why it is highly preferred by patients suffering from pain and insomnia. However, since it is an indica dominant strain, it is better for night time use. Black Berry Kush has a lot of medical applications and is prescribed to patients who are unable to cope with nervousness, anxiety and stress."
Fruity Pebbles Strain,"Fruity Pebbles, also known as Fruity Pebbles OG, is an indica dominant hybrid (55% indica/45% sativa) created by breeders at the infamous Alien Genetics cannabis farms. This dank bud is a cross between the hugely popular"
Jager Strain,"Jager, also known more simply as “Jgr” to most of the cannabis community, is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain named for the infamous adult beverage that has mixed accounts of its origins. Many believe that it is a Hindu Kush descendant due to its effects and smell, but many others argue that it must be a descendant of the Southern Oregon strain because of its appearance. Regardless of its genetics, Jager is one delicious and effective smoke, with THC levels reaching up to 23%. Much like the real Jager, this bud has an aroma of sweet earthy licorice and a taste of woody lemon pine with a hint of rich licorice upon exhale that becomes intensely sweet at times. These buds have long tapered pepper-shaped forest green nugs with deep rich purple undertones, fiery orange hairs, and a thinly spread layer of fine clear crystal trichomes. This high is characterized by full-bodied indica effects that slowly creep on before hitting you like too many drinks. You’ll suddenly feel completely relaxed in both mind and body with tendencies towards introspection and becoming spacey. You won’t be completely sedated in this state – rather, just blissfully out of it. Due to these effects, Jager is often used to treat chronic pain, inflammation, tremors, and muscle spasms."

Grape Kush Strain,"Grape Krush is an indica dominant hybrid strain and has a 60:40 indica/sativa ratio. The strain belongs to the Blueberry family which explains why it has an exquisite taste and flavor. The buds tend to be dark green in color with hues of purple. You will also notice larger calyxes which is high unusual considering its heritage. The nuggets are round and dense making it more visually appealing than it already is. On the other hand, the aroma is both musky and sweet. The taste is not that different but it is quite soothing and does not burn your throat during the inhale or exhale. Before giving Grape Krush a try, you need to keep in mind that it is a creeper. The strain is not to be taken lightly and should be consumed in smaller doses. Grape Krush is quite potent and will knock you out if you are not careful. The effects can make you feel sleepy and sedated but you will have a sense of clarity which is something to look forward to. But then again, you will not feel like doing anything else and will restrict yourself from moving even an inch. That being said, it is important for you to keep in mind that the strain is effective in terms of dealing with medical conditions like stress, anxiety, depression and muscle spasms."
Godzilla Glue Strain,Godzilla Glue is a rare evenly balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain created through crossing the classic
Damn Sour Strain,"Damn Sour is a sativa dominant hybrid (80% sativa/20% indica) strain that descends from the delicious and tangy Sage N Sour strain. This dank bud offers the user a powerful THC level that ranges from 17-22% and potent cerebral sativa effects. The high begins almost immediately after smoking with a flood of near overwhelming cerebral euphoria. You’ll feel completely uplifted and motivated with a sense of purpose and motivation that makes you ready and willing to tackle any task at hand. These effects make Damn Sour a perfect wake-and-bake strain that leave you full of energy and blissfully happy. Because of these effects and its potent THC level, Damn Sour is said to be the perfect strain for treating chronic pain, muscle spasms, appetite loss, and chronic fatigue. Damn Sour is infamous among cannabis users for its harsh and intensely sour aroma of ammonia and tar and a taste of tangy sour chemicals with a hint of pungent diesel upon exhale. This bud has small to medium-sized airy neon green pebble-shaped nugs that are covered with curly leaves and thick furry almost translucent amber hairs. These nugs are caked with chunky white crystal trichomes and dripping with sticky sweet resin."

Theraplant 14008 Strain,"Theraplant 14008 is an East Coast regional specialty with high THC levels (more than 17%) and strong sativa effects. It's a crossbreed of Chemdawg, D Tang, and Blue Velvet. It's a sativa-dominant hybrid, but the exact ratio of sativa to indica is unknown. This strain is a favorite among those lucky enough to try it, but outside of Connecticut it may be hard to find. A local cultivator known as Theraplant first bred this medical strain for its cerebral high and herbal citrus flavors. The effects are energized and euphoric, with a strong mood boost that's helpful in treating depression and anxiety. Theraplant 14008 is also known to treat muscle spasms and poor appetite, making it ideal for patients who need to gain weight. CBD levels are very low, only about 0.2%, so this isn't a good treatment for patients suffering from seizures or other conditions that respond to CBD. There are few reports of negative effects, though that may be more because this strain is so rare than because there are none. As usual, dry mouth is probably the most likely side effect."
Purple Haze Strain,Purple Haze is a sativa dominant hybrid (85% sativa/15% indica) strain that is a potent cross between the rare yet popular
CPS Depacan Strain,"CPS Depacan is a super rare sativa dominant hybrid strain with unknown parentage due to a general lack of information about its heritage. This bud has a moderate THC level of about 10-15% and a high 1-3% average CBD level, making it a great choice for any user who needs a little bit of power behind their relief. The CPS Depacan high is relatively mellow in nature, with long-lasting lifted effects that are ideal for pain-killing among many other treatments. You’ll feel a happy lift at the onset of the high that’s accompanied by a building sense of energy that won’t cause anxiety or leave you feeling paranoid. This is accompanied by an increase in sociability that lends itself well to conversation and social activities. As your mind expands through deep happiness, your body will be washed over with a moderate sense of relaxation that won’t weigh you down. Because of these effects, CPS Depacan is often chosen for treating conditions such as chronic stress or anxiety, depression, inflammation, and chronic fatigue. This bud has heart-shaped bright neon green nugs with long furry brownish hairs that are coated in milky white crystal trichomes. CPS Depacan has a mellow herbal skunky flavor with a spicy aroma to match."
Cali Gold Strain,"Cali Gold is an indica strain and is quite popular amongst individuals who have been smoking cannabis for quite some time. It offers an amazing kick and an exceptional flavor at the same time. Upon closer inspection, the buds turn out silvery green in color. You may also notice dark orange hairs amidst the greens but what truly sets it apart are its prominent crystals. As for the smell, it is fruity and strong. The smell can linger in places for a while before you can get rid of it. The taste is fruity when exhaling but green during the inhale and is different from any other strain you may have medicated with before. Most users feel dazed out as soon as they smoke the strain. The high is known for its relaxing effects and will calm you in no time. It is the perfect wake and bake strain but it should not underestimated. Cali Gold is not recommended for individuals who are new to smoking cannabis but experienced users can use it as a daytime strain. The strain is most commonly recommended for patients who are suffering from depression, anxiety and anorexia."
Cadillac Purple Strain,"Cadillac Purple is primarily an indica strain and is a cross between Purple Urkle, The Black and Blackberry Kush. The strain has a THC content that falls anywhere in between 18 and 22% and is quite potent to say the least. The buds are dense and are dark green in color with hues of purple splashed here and there. Cadillac Purple smells really good and is no different from any perfume you own. It is floral with a distinct sweet flavor that will keep you coming back for more after each hit. Surprisingly, the taste lingers in the mouth for longer and leaves a pleasant aftertaste for you to enjoy. The strain is popular amongst individuals looking for an unparalleled body relaxation. But that is not all. Its effects offer great relief for those in pain. However, most individuals find it disappointing as they do not get to enjoy the spacey cerebral effects they have come to love and enjoy from most indica strains. It should be kept in mind that the strain is a creeper. Cadillac Purple will hit you when you least expect it. But then again, it is quite effective against several medical conditions including stress, tiredness, depression, anxiety and anorexia."

Early Sativa Strain,"Early Sativa is a 100% pure Landrace sativa strain native to Canada that was bred specifically to handle the country’s rough climates and temperatures year-round. With a mild THC level between 12-14% and a delicious flavor, Early Sativa is a perfect strain for all levels of users. Early Sativa buds have a fresh and fruity lemon aroma and a taste akin to drinking a glass of freshly made strawberry lemonade with a tangy yet sweet aftertaste. These buds have medium-sized spade-shaped neon green nugs with a spattering of light amber almost translucent hairs and scattered patches of light minty green undertones. Each nug is dusted with milky white trichomes and is covered with a thick layer of sticky sweet resin.

You’ll have a mildly uplifted cerebral energy that leads to euphoria and motivation to be social and active. This is accompanied by a surprising sense of relaxation not common to many sativa strains. Because of these mellow yet euphoric effects, Early Sativa is said to be ideal for treating chronic fatigue, mild depression, chronic pain, and nausea."
Dutch Treat Strain,"Not surprisingly, Dutch Treat is an Amsterdam staple, an indica-dominant hybrid with a 20:80 sativa/indica ratio. The strain's limited sativa genetics produce a near-instant head rush, followed by a numbing body high somewhere short of couch-lock. Dutch Treat has THC levels reaching 18-25%, so it's strong but not aggressively so. It smells like eucalyptus and has a sweet, earthy pine flavor. The head high is intensely euphoric and upbeat, while the body high is deeply relaxed. Dutch Treat works well on anxiety and pain, and it's also helpful with insomnia. This strain is recommended for ADHD, PTSD, migraines, and arthritis. Adverse effects include dry mouth and red eyes. Outside Holland, Dutch Treat is most popular in the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest United States. It's a descendant of Northern Lights, a famed indica; skunk, a potent hybrid; and Haze, one of the most popular sativas of all time. That mixed but esteemed heritage makes Dutch Treat a fun, effective treatment for both mental and physical suffering. As a heavy indica, this strain can be a bit hard to find, but it's common enough in places where marijuana is legal."
Greenhouse blend Strain,"Greenhouse Blend, also known as “Greenhouse OG,” is a clone only indica dominant hybrid strain that is exclusive to a single dispensary in Pacific Beach, California near San Diego. Although it’s a rare find, Greenhouse Blend is a local patient-favorite descendant of OG Kush grown in an all-organic greenhouse. The Greenhouse Blend high is incredibly strong and long-lasting, fueled by a powerful 18-23% average THC level that can prove overpowering to novice users. The high hits you hard with an immediate euphoric effect that quickly fades into a stoney cerebral buzz. This buzz will slowly ebb throughout the rest of your body in tingly waves, leaving you completely sedated and couch-locked with a sharp pang of hunger that will have you eating anything you can find, that is if you can get off the couch. This full-body stone will last for two hours or more and can leave some users falling asleep almost immediately after toking a few times. Because of these effects, Greenhouse Blend is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, appetite loss, nausea, and chronic stress. This bud has an earthy lemony flavor of sweet pine and herbs and an aroma of kushy herbs and woody earth with a pungent effect that’s released as the nugs are broken apart. Greenhouse Blend buds have dense and leafy bright neon green small round nugs with amber hairs and a frosty thick coating of golden milky trichomes."

GSC x Bubba Kush Strain,"GSC X Bubba Kush, also known as “Bubba Scout,” is an indica dominant hybrid strain that packs a super potent 20% + average THC level into each tasty little nugget. The GSC X Bubba Kush is very relaxing in nature and hits harder in the head than the body, even with its indica dominance. The high comes on slowly, lifting your cerebral state subtly before launching you into hazy happiness. You’ll start to fall deeper and deeper into beautiful calming visions that leave you distracted and introspective without causing anxiety or paranoia. As your mind falls slowly away, your body will start to relax into a buzzy body high that won’t leave you too sedated or couch-locked.

Maple Wreck Strain,"Maple Wreck is a heavily sativa dominant hybrid strain (90% sativa/10% indica) created as a phenotype of the infamous Trainwreck strain. Named for its insanely delicious flavor, Maple Wreck packs tastes of sweet maple syrup and rich sugary woods into each and every toke. The aroma follows the same profile, although with a light touch of earth and herbs as the nugs are burned. The Maple Wreck high comes blasting in almost as soon as you exhale, launching your mind into a purely lifted state of heady euphoria. As your mind soars higher and higher, you’ll start to feel an influx of creative energy and motivation with a touch of focus that will help you get going on any artistic undertakings that you have at hand.

This bud has long minty green spade-shaped nugs with thin clear amber hairs and a coating of sandy amber crystal trichomes dotted with sweet sticky resin."
Afghani Strain,"Afghani may be one of the most popular marijuana strains the world has ever seen. Though this strain isn't as powerful as its long history suggests (THC levels at about 17-20%%), this strain is certainly strong enough to deliver a deep, sedated body high with a strong shot of euphoria. CBD levels are low, considerably less than 1%. A near-pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 5:95), this strain was named got its name from its home country, where it grows in the Hindu Kush Mountains. This is close to the mountainous region where humans first tamed wild cannabis thousands of years ago. Afghani, also known as Afghan Kush, is a source of countless hybrid strains around the world, many of them very popular. Best used to treat chronic pain and anxiety, this strain is also good for insomnia due to its heavy indica genes. Afghani has a pungent, earthy smell and taste, with a sweet flavor. The high is deeply relaxed, with strong euphoria and a mood boost. It's best used late at night, since it can easily induce sleep. Dry mouth is a distinct possibility, as are dry eyes, headache, and dizziness. Afghani is most popular on the West Coast, in Colorado, and in British Columbia."

Charlotte's Web was named after Charlotte Figi, a young Colorado girl with severe epilepsy whose constant seizures were stopped by this strain. Her story brought public attention to a cause that has helped secure medical marijuana laws in more than a dozen states. Charlotte's Web won't get you high; its THC content is substantially less than 1%. But the CBD content can hit 17% or higher, making this one of the most powerful marijuana medications available. Charlotte's Web is a sativa-dominant hybrid (40:60 sativa/indica ratio). It's highly effective at treating pediatric seizure disorders, while it also helps with pain, muscle spasms, and headaches. The overall effect is entirely physical, with no intoxication, even in children and first-time users. This strain has a strong pine smell, with floral tones and an earthy taste."

Acapulco Gold Strain,"This famous sativa-dominant hybrid, which has an 80:20 sativa/indica ratio, combines a powerful head high with a soothing body high that last for at least two hours. Acapulco Gold originated in Acapulco, Mexico, but no one seems to remember who first grew it or what parent strains were used. Acapulco Gold is pretty hard to find because it's difficult to grow indoors, but it's popular throughout the United States, especially in warmer climes. It's best used to treat anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, but it's also good for insomnia and headaches, as well as some mental disorders. This strain can be especially powerful, with THC levels as high as 24%. It has a distinct earthy flavor and aroma, with a taste of chestnut and tealeaves. As with most strains, the most likely adverse effects are dry eyes and dry mouth. Paranoia and dizziness are also possible but less common. Acapulco Gold is most popular in the Western United States, the Upper Midwest, and the desert Southwest. It often costs more than other strains because of its potency and the beautiful gold-tinged appearance of its bud."
Orange Kush Strain,"The sativa genes of OG Kush and the indica genes of Orange Bud were blended to form Orange Kush, allegedly an indica-dominant hybrid (reports on the sativa/indica ratio of this strain are unreliable at best). The flavor is tangy and citrusy while the smell has strong, sweet notes of orange. The buds have lime-green leaves and bright orange hairs to match the name. THC levels are known to top 22%, making this one of the strongest strains on any market, legal or otherwise. CBD, on the other hand, is very scarce, less than half of 1 percent, much too low to suggest Orange Kush as good treatment for seizure disorders and other problems that can be alleviated with CBD. The effects of this strain certainly hint at its indica leanings: powerful euphoria, deep physical relaxation, happiness, sleepiness, and a potent case of the munchies. That alone makes this a great tool in treating eating or wasting disorders, but Orange Kush is also a good choice for patients who suffer from anxiety, depression, ADHD, inflammation, migraine headaches, muscle spasms, and aches and pains. Negatives may include dry eyes and cottonmouth. This strain is most popular in Arizona and the Pacific Northwest."
Strawberry Kush Strain,"Strawberry Kush is sweet, strong and truly well-rounded. This strain certainly justifies its lineage and contains a musky artificial strawberry taste with a THC content of up to 23 percent. It is essentially found as a cross between the bitter OG Kush and the sugary Strawberry Cough and is mostly strong but not overwhelming. Based on the dispensary, the ancestry of this strain tends to vary. Certain dispensaries contain more sativa-dominant or hybrid versions that lead to opposite, stimulating effects. This strain typically blossoms in eight to nine weeks and is obtainable by cloning only. In its make-up, Strawberry Kush contains Sativa genetics and it is smoked more as a Sativa than an Indica. Upon lighting this weed, one instantly identifies citrus, pine and of course, strawberry. A clean flavor is provided by the fruity combination and the buzz of this weed mentally stimulates a person, leaving them alert and ready for action. Strawberry Kush is a good smoke for daytime use since it will not make you drowsy. From a medical perspective, it helps patients with stress and appetite loss."
Mandala #1 Strain,"Mandala #1 is Sativa dominant hybrid cannabis strain that is produced by crossing N. Indian Sativa, NZ Purple Indica and S. African highland Sativa. It can be cultivated both, indoors and outdoors. It has a flowering period of 55 to 60 days. Mandala #1 has a moderate yield of 450g/m2 and results in a medium to slightly tall plant. Its dense buds are really pretty and have a colorful appearance and are covered with crystals. It has a strong effect on your system and makes you feel highly energized and happy. Mandala #1 is a potent strain with a THC level ranging between 18 percent and 21 percent. It has a CBD content of 0.2 percent and CBG level of 1 percent. It has a lovely and natural fragrance with a sweet undertone and an aftertaste similar to that of fresh apples. Its aroma has a citrus, lemon and lime hint as well. This strain has a lovely taste that is a blend of earthy and citrus flavors. Mandala #1 is a good cure for depression and stress of several kinds."
NYC Diesel Strain,"Sour Diesel meets an original Afghani or Hawaiian strain in this sativa-dominant hybrid (60:40 sativa/indica ratio). NYC Diesel carries strong sativa genes from its Sour Diesel mother, while the father plant was either indica- or sativa-dominant. This strain is a good choice for busy days and social occasions, as it provides a peppy cerebral high with strong energy. THC levels can exceed 21%, making this a particularly potent medical option. CBD concentration, on the other hand, is very low, typical for a sativa. The high comes with a strong shot of euphoria, a mood boost, and a spark of creativity. It's most useful when treating anxiety, chronic pain, and depression. It can also be an effective appetite stimulant. Negative effects are limited, especially paranoia, and that makes this an ideal choice for patients suffering from chronic anxiety. A strong, pungent fuel flavor predominates in this Diesel descendant, along with additional chemical notes.

The strain is better suited for nighttime use and has been used on several occasions to treat medical conditions like insomnia and chronic pains and aches."

Romulan Strain,"Romulan, naturally, gets its name from the hostile alien race in Star Trek.

It's almost pure indica with a small amount of the sativa-dominant White Rhino hybrid, but its full origins are a mystery. Romulan has a sweet earthy smell and taste, with hints of pine and citrus. It produces a deeply relaxed body high with a dreamy, floating sensation. Like all indicas, Romulan can be effective at treating anxiety, though it's best for pain.

This strain can be found on legal medical markets in California, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, and Canada. It may appear on the black market in some places, so while it's relatively popular, it isn't exactly a staple among patients."

The buds are quite dense and sticky, but incredibly soft at the same time. You will find an abundance of orange, reds and beautiful hues of green. Even though it looks like any other Kush strain, you can immediately identify its aroma due to Jack being a part of the genetics. The smell is unique with its mint pepper chemical scent with hints of vanilla cream, pungent fruit and lemon rind. However, the taste is not as spicy as you would expect it to be, but it is more or less the same as its smell. After smoking the strain, you will immediately feel overwhelmed by a sativa buzz. But then again your body will remain medicated enough due to the Kush found in the strain's genetics. The high gains momentum gradually and you might feel a bit stoned, but it is not something an experienced cannabis user can't handle. The high can easily last anywhere in between two to three hours. Due to its numbing effects, it is often recommended for patients suffering from chronic pains and aches. Additionally, you can also use it to regain your lost appetite."
Blue God Strain,"This strain is a near-pure indica, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica isn't widely reported. THC and CBD levels are also hard to come by, though reviews suggest it's a relatively potent medical choice. At least one test indicates THC can make up more than 20% of this strain. But the lack of data on CBD content makes Blue God a poor choice for patients who need CBD preparations to treat seizures or other health problems. On the other hand, this is a very good choice for treating irritability, chronic pain, insomnia, and daily stress. The high is largely physical, with a calming body buzz, sleepiness, and couch-lock effects. But there are also limited cerebral qualities, including psychoactive euphoria. Grape and Kush are the dominant notes in the taste and smell of this pungent strain, while the nugs are dark, purple, and sticky. Expect the usual side effects, including dry mouth and watery eyes, though specific reports are scarce. Blue God isn't especially popular, but it sells at medical marijuana dispensaries in California, Oregon, Colorado, Arizona, and British Columbia."

This definitely isn't the most potent strain on the market, with THC levels well below 20% (about 16% in some tests). It also isn't terribly impressive with its low CBD content, less than 1%. Still, some patients may find the easy cerebral high very pleasant. The experience is typically clear-headed and creative, with a boost of energy and sociability, and a mood boost. It's best used to alleviate anxiety, depression, irritability, migraine headaches, and everyday stress. Side effects are likely minimal, but expect some dry mouth and dry eyes.

The effects of the strain are both energizing and uplifting at the same time. The high is cerebral and does not offer that much of a body buzz which is to be expected of such a strain. Its effects are primarily psychoactive but allow patients suffering from chronic pains and aches to get some relief. But then again, it is just as effective at treating several other medical conditions including loss of appetite, insomnia and even nausea. Considering its effects and properties, the strain is highly recommended for nighttime use."

Purple Bubba Kush Strain,"Purple Bubba Kush, also known merely as Purple Bubba, is a mix of Purple Kush and Bubba Kush, both pure indica strains. That means Purple Bubba Kush is itself a heavy indica, with a calm, relaxing high and a strong dose of couch-lock. THC levels exceed 21% in some tests, making this strain typically very potent. CBD levels, however, are almost nonexistent in this strain, much less than 1%. That rules this strain out as an effective medication for seizure disorders, but it's helpful at treating many other problems, including lack of appetite, chronic pain, insomnia, and anxiety. The effects are intensely physical and long-lasting, so save this treat for late at night or a work-free rainy day. Cottonmouth is a common side effect, as is bloodshot eyes, while headaches, dizziness, and paranoia are much less likely. Purple Bubba Kush has a smooth, fruity taste and aroma, while the nugs have a light green appearance with bright orange strands and a thick, silver layer of trichomes. This strain isn't widely known or appreciated, but it might be found on legal markets in the American West."

Purple Nepal Strain,"Lemon Thai was mixed with an unknown original Nepalese strain to create this peppy, potent indica (sativa/indica ration unclear).

Those numbers mean this strain provides a particularly intense, indica-driven body high with deep physical relaxation, sleepiness, and powerful hunger balanced against creativity, arousal, and upbeat mood. As a result, Purple Nepal is a good strain for treating lack of appetite, inflammation, chronic pain, stress, insomnia, and depression. But it's probably much less effective in treating seizure disorders and other conditions that are alleviated with CBD, as that chemical is definitely in short supply in Purple Nepal. True to its name, this strain produces green and purple buds with brown hairs and generates an earthy grape flavor and smell. Dry eyes are common, and other side effects include cottonmouth, paranoia, dizziness, and limited headaches. Purple Nepal is relatively popular as purps strains go, and patients should be able to find it on the medical marijuana markets in California, Oregon, Washington State, Colorado, and, increasingly, Massachusetts."

The nuggets are bright green in color and quite fresh at the same time. The buds are covered in crystals and are not dry as you would expect them to be. The strain smells great and is a perfect blend of light berry scents that will leave you thunderstruck. As for the taste, it does not disappoint. It is just as good as the smell and easy to distinguish from any other strain you may have smoked before. The strain packs a punch and has a light berry taste that you will keep you coming back for more. The strain is not to be underestimated as it is quite potent and can knock you out for good if you are not careful. The body buzz is quite strong but it will not drain you. You will feel happy and energized which is perfect if you wish to concentrate and focus on the task at hand. But then again, considering its potency it is not recommended to individuals who are new to smoking cannabis. However, Incrediberry is quite effective at treating several medical conditions, like anorexia, muscle spasms, depression and anxiety."
Gremlin Strain,"THC levels are high in this potent sativa-dominant hybrid, upwards of 20%, while CBD levels are extremely low, just a fraction of 1%. Apart from those details, not much is known about this rare strain, including its exact sativa/indica ratio (it's at least 70:30, possibly higher). But as a sativa, Gremlin is best used for daytime purposes when energy and focus are critical. The head high is alert and relaxed, making this strain a good bet for treating depression, fatigue, stress, and anxiety. It also provides an antidepressant mood boost that can last for hours. Gremlin has a strong, sweet citrus flavor and a similar smell. The buds have a white frosted appearance due to a thick layer of resinous trichomes. This medical strain is worth trying at least once, especially for those with active daily lives, but it's decidedly hard to find. Look for it on the legal markets of the West Coast, but don't expect to see it much of anywhere else. Gremlin has THC levels that many patients would find appealing, but demand for it is weak at best."
Maui Sunset Strain,"Most patients would have to travel far to see a real Maui sunset, and the same is true of the marijuana version. It's a sativa-dominant hybrid with a sativa/indica ratio of at least 70:30 and as much as 90:10. That means the effects probably focus primarily on the head. But it's impossible to say for sure without actually trying Maui Sunset, since there's next to nothing about it on the public record. There are no reports on its medicinal uses, though anxiety and depression are usually good bets. Likewise there are no tests indicating how much of this plant is THC and how much of it is CBD. If it were an especially potent medical tool, there would probably be more information about Maui Sunset, so the lack of it suggests it's not high in either chemical. It probably shouldn't be used as the only treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD, given the lack of reliable data on that substance. Nobody seems to know what this strain smells, tastes, or looks like, but there are likely tropical notes."
Rene Mist Strain,Rene Mist is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid (60% sativa/40% indica) strain created through a cross of the classic
White Elephant Strain,"There are two strains that use this name, the other being an indica-dominant cross of White Widow and Purple Elephant. This strain, on the other hand, is a sativa-dominant cross of White Rhino and an unknown sativa. The exact ratio of sativa to indica is unclear. THC levels are also a mystery with this strain, though there's a good deal of information about the other White Elephant. But the effects are known to be both physical and mental, with an enjoyable body buzz and an energized boost of euphoria. That makes this strain a good choice for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. It's not ideal for seizure disorders, however, as it's low in CBD, much less than 1%. White Elephant tastes of Kush, with sweet pine notes. The smell is pungent, earthy, and spicy. There's little available data on adverse effects, but dry mouth is common in almost all strains, as are dry eyes. The other White Elephant isn't as hard to find as this one. The West Coast is probably the best bet, though even there a search for this White Elephant will probably only lead to the other White Elephant."

It should not be taken if there is a busy night planned ahead because the smoker feels very lazy after taking a hit of this Kush.

Lemon CBD Strain,"Lemon CBD, also known as “Lemon Aid,” is a rare sativa dominant hybrid strain created through crossing the classic Lemon Skunk and the rare One to One strains. The result is an insanely tasty smoke and highly medicinal effects that ease aches and pains for hours on end without the trippy effects that come from a high THC bud.

The Lemon CBD high is pretty mellow in nature, with a lifted relaxing overtone that leaves you completely at ease for hours after just a few hits. These effects come on slowly and build with a happy effect, eliminating any anxiety or paranoia. Thanks to these effects and its super high CBD level, Lemon CBD is said to be perfect for treating a wide variety of conditions including chronic pain, nausea, chronic stress or anxiety, inflammation, muscle spasms or cramps, and depression.

Platinum Fire OG Strain,"The sour, diesel-like aroma of this pure indica powerhouse (0:100 sativa/indica ratio) hints at a Sour Diesel ancestor, but the exact genetics of Platinum Fire OG are unclear. There isn't much public data on the level of THC in this strain, but it's rumored to be a very potent choice. It produces a deeply relaxing and sleepy body buzz that can be used to fight a wide range of health problems: migraine headaches, mood disorders, chronic pain, nerve pain, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and tumors, among others. But there are few public reports on how much CBD can be found in this strain, so patients shouldn't rely on it as the sole treatment for seizures or other conditions that can be alleviated with CBD. Dry mouth is the most commonly reported side effect with Platinum Fire OG, but dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia are also possible. The flavor and smell of this intense medical tool have distinct notes of sour diesel fuel, while the bud is multicolored with dark green leaves and bright red hairs. This intense medical tool can be found throughout the American West, but even there it's only moderately popular."

Sour Grape Strain,"This medical marijuana strain is a pungent hybrid that was created by crossing the famous bed time indica strain, 'Granddaddy Purple' with the most extensively smoked sativa strain, 'Sour Diesel'. This is often confused with the craft marijuana strain, ""Sour Grapes"", which was created by crossing 'Sour Diesel' with 'Grape Ape'. Both these are different from each other and hence, the users who are intending to buy Sour Grape are recommended to inquire about the parent strains while buying. The buds of this plant are quite denser with purple colored undertones all over them. These indica-dominant buds would give the users with a sweet, sour and grapey flavor and would be more or less like that of a candy. The aroma that is being produced by this strain will also be sour in nature. In addition, we would get fuel-like and fruity undertones. The flowers will be chunky and will be covered with a thick layer of frosty natured trichomes. The effects of this strain are found to relax the muscles and would work fine for the users who are fighting muscle tension and stress."

Suzy Q Strain,"Suzy Q is a super rare evenly balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain with unknown parentage due to an extremely high level of breeder secrecy. And given its 59:1 CBD:THC level, you can understand why this medicinal powerhouse’s heritage is so closely guarded. Suzy Q is considered to be one of the most medicinal strains on the market, with its CBD levels hitting 5-25% and THC levels falling below the 0.3% mark. Because of its potent CBD and almost nonexistent THC, the effects of Suzy Q are incredibly mellow, offering a subtle lift of spirits and a slight infusion of energy that almost goes unnoticed.

Blueberry Garlic Strain,"Blueberry Garlic is an indica-heavy hybrid that was likely created by crossing a Blueberry strain with Garlic Bud, both indicas. The exact ratio of sativa to indica is unknown, however. It's known to be highly potent, though THC levels register around 16%, less than most top-shelf strains. CBD is much lower, only about 0.5%.

The dried bud has a speckled green-and-brown appearance with a light dusting of trichomes providing a fuzzy look. Dry mouth is probably the most common side effect, though data on the subject is scarce. Bloodshot eyes and paranoia may also be possible.

The effects are worth the experience, if only once."
Pickle Strain,"Pickle is a mild choice for treating chronic pain, anxiety, low mood, and muscle spasms. It's apparently a sativa-dominant hybrid, at least judging by its mostly cerebral effects, but its exact genetics are largely a mystery. The THC levels in Pickle are also hard to verify, but there's little public evidence to suggest they're anything but modest. The head buzz is calming but energized, with clear mental focus, creativity, and euphoria. Very little is known about the CBD content of this strain, which means it probably shouldn't be used as the exclusive treatment for epilepsy or other conditions that respond to CBD concentrates. True to its name, Pickle has a distinct dill flavor, while its odor is earthy, musky, and sour. The tiny buds are roughly the size of popped popcorn kernels. This strain isn't popular enough to generate credible public reports of negative side effects, but red eyes and dry mouth are common with most strains.

MKU Strain,"The MKU is bred from the O.G Kush and the G-13. Indica dominates the effects of this medical marijuana strain. The MKU type has light green buds, which are frosted all over with tri-chromes. It sends the smokers in a sensational high, which starts with a body buzz and then dies down to a calm. The smoker is couch locked for a while after smoking the MKU. The positive effects of this strain make it a viable treatment for depression because it releases endorphins in the brain, which makes the smokers euphoric and uplifts the spirits. It also calms the nerves hence it is suitable for people suffering from pain related to neuropathy or bodily aches. It relaxes the body and dissipates all the stiffness in the joints and muscles making the person feel invigorated. Patients suffering from stress and anxiety also take this brand of marijuana as it soothes the mind and sends all negative feelings away. The MKU with each inhale and exhale tastes like a citrusy fruit, soothing herbs with a zing of spices. It is a treat for the taste buds and the nose as well. The aroma is very herbal and does not bother the olfactory senses."
Confusion Kush Strain,"Confusion Kush is an indica dominant hybrid strain with unknown parentage due to breeder secrecy and general disagreement among users, although it is widely accepted that it is a member of the OG Kush family. Like OG Kush, Confusion Kush has an aroma of pungent earthy pine with a grassy fresh herbal smell that’s released as the nugs are burned. The taste is of sweet grassy lemon with a hint of pine and a fresh exhale of dampened earth. This bud has fluffy popcorn-shaped dark green nugs with dark purple undertones, bright orange hairs, and a thick coating of clear crystal trichomes and visible droplets of sticky sweet resin. The Confusion Kush high is disorienting at best, with a hazy cerebral state accompanied by soaring psychedelic introspection. The high starts with a euphoric head rush that boosts your mood and leaves you feeling insanely happy and at ease. This quickly fades into cloudy introspection and can lead to some psychedelic effects at times. As your spaciness builds, you’ll fall victim to a lazy sleepy state that can knock you flat out if you’re not careful. Because of these effects and its powerful 23% THC level, Confusion Kush is a favorite for treating migraines or headaches, nausea, chronic stress, depression, and mood swings."
Kushman OG Strain,"Kushman OG is a sativa dominant hybrid strain that is a specially bred private reserve selection of OG Kush created by renowned grower Kyle Kushman. This bud is a hard one to find on the market and there is very little verified information out about it because of this. Although the exact indica to sativa ratio is unknown, it is known to be a heavy sativa strain in terms of effects. The high starts with a cerebral head rush that launches your mind straight into clear-headed euphoria and a sense of energy. You’ll be motivated and uplifted, ready to conquer anything that comes your way. Other than these effects, very little is known about Kushman OG’s effects. These sativa heavy effects coupled with its powerful 25% average THC level make Kushman OG ideal for more experienced users rather than novices, especially considering that it can cause paranoia in some. This bud is perfect for treating conditions such as mood swings, chronic stress, depression, inattentiveness, and migraines. The smells and flavor of Kushman OG is very much like its parent with strong notes of earthy pine and woody pungency. A fresh spicy herbal scent can be detected as the nugs are broken apart and smoked. These buds have long and lumpy cone-shaped dark forest green nugs with furry dark red hairs and a sparse crystal chunky trichomes."
Louis OG Strain,"Louis OG is an indica dominant strain with 20% THC content, which is renowned for generating a spacey mind-warp along with a strong body-buzz. If you get your hands on the strain, you will come to realize it smells skunky and sweet and tastes just about the same, but has a lemony ting to it. However, it is quite light on the throat and its aroma is something you would like to have around the room all day regardless of how it may smell. Additionally, it tastes even more pungent, but should keep you coming back for seconds. The fluffy nugs are light green in color and look quite tempting but should not be underestimated. After smoking the strain, you will notice that the effects kick in almost immediately. The effects start off with very strong mind and body relaxation that grows and continues to increase into even stronger cerebral and euphoric effects. You will feel most of these effects behind the eyes and in the frontal lobe of the brain. Do not be surprised if you feel weighed down and are caused to lock into your couch. The strain has a lot of medical uses and can be used by patients suffering from panic disorders, eating disorders, chronic pain, nausea, seizures and even Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is safe to say it is a potent marijuana strain that has numerous medical uses which explains why it is a favorite amongst some of the most popular recording artists including B-Real and Snoop Dog."
Dark Star Strain,"Dark Star, also known as DarkStar, is a pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100) that comes with relatively modest THC levels but several good medical uses. This strain is apparently the result of a cross between two popular originals, Purple Kush and Mazar-i-Sharif. Tests suggest THC levels can top 19%, putting this in the medium range as far as potency is concerned. The few available CBD tests show that chemical is scarce in this strain, too scarce to recommend Dark Star as treatment for epilepsy of other conditions that respond to CBD preparations. The indica genes in this strain produce a calming physical buzz with euphoria, happiness, and some limited cerebral effects. It's a good source of medicine for chronic body pain, everyday stress, and lack of appetite, as it can generate a powerful case of the munchies. The flavor and aroma of Dark Star both have strong, sweet notes of coffee and soil. There isn't much information on side effects, but patients should expect at least some of the usual culprits: dry mouth, dry eyes, paranoia, dizziness, and headaches. Available in both Europe and the United States, this strain sells best in Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Michigan, Spain, and the Netherlands."

Sour Diesel #2 Strain,"The strain is a sativa dominant hybrid with an acceptable 16% THC content. With a 10:90 indica/sativa ratio the strain does not disappoint. Sour Diesel #2 has some of the densest buds, which are completely wrapped with orange-pinkish hairs. Additionally, it has petals, which are dark green in color and at times can easily be mistaken for a charred color. The aroma is overpowering with a hint of pine, which is dominated with a heavy/thick earthy-diesel smell. As for the taste, it is not as earthy as you would expect it to be. What is really interesting is that the taste is more sour and is quite pleasant with a diesel flavor that will do more than appeal to your taste buds. Sour Diesel # 2 is not your usual sativa strain. Rest assured it will not knock you out but it provides a nice clear headed high. You will feel extremely euphoric and happy, which is never a bad thing of course. But one of the best things about the strain is that it numbs your body and can help you overcome chronic aches and pains as well. On the other hand, it is just as effective as a mood elevator and can help you treat conditions like anxiety and depression."

Purple Rhino Strain,"White Rhino, a well-known near-pure indica, and the beloved original Mendocino Purps, an indica-heavy hybrid, were crossed to make this delightful hybrid, itself an indica-heavy hybrid. The exact ratio of indica to sativa is unclear, but THC levels are high in Purple Rhino, reaching 20% in some analyses. On the other hand, CBD levels are very low, far less than 1%, too low to recommend this as a good source of medicine for seizure disorders and other conditions that can be treated with CBD. But the calming high, a mix of both body and cerebral effects, is effective in alleviating anxiety, depression, muscle spasms, chronic pain, and insomnia. Though it's fine any time of day, Purple Rhino is most effective at night, inducing deep relaxation and strong couch-lock effects. The buds are light green in color, with purple and amber strands and a heavy coat of trichomes. This strain has a sweet, distinctive flavor of berries and citrus, with a similar aroma. Side effects aren't widely reported, but it's a safe guess that dry mouth is one of them. Bloodshot eyes and paranoia may also be possible. This strain is decidedly not popular, as it's hard to find pretty much everywhere in the United States. It may appear on the black market, but don't expect it."
sour blueberry Strain,"Sour Blueberry, not to be confused with “Blueberry Diesel,” is a rare slightly indica dominant hybrid (60% indica/40% sativa) strain created through crossing the classic Blueberry with an unknown strain. Even with the lack of knowledge about its heritage, Sour Blueberry is sought after by users all over the country thanks to its insanely delicious flavor and clear-headed effects. Sour Blueberry has a flavor exactly like what you’d expect – sweet and sour blueberries! The aroma is very fresh and fruity as well with a sour citrus overtone accented by sweet berries and earth. Sour Blueberry has a high that’s just as addictive as the flavor, with clear uplifting effects that leave you aware and focused for hours on end. You’ll feel a euphoric onset almost immediately after your first exhale, infusing you with a sense of wellbeing and motivation. An increase in energy comes next, giving you the boost you need to actually get up and get things done. Thanks to these effects and its moderate 14% average THC level, Sour Bluebery is the perfect bud to treat seizures, neuropathy, spinal cord injuries, epilepsy, hypertension, and MS. This bud has heavy dense forest green nugs with sparse red orange hairs and a coating of tiny yellow green crystal trichomes."

Gorilla Breath Strain,Gorilla Breath is an indica dominant hybrid strain (80% indica/20% sativa) created through crossing the classic Original Glue (AKA – Gorilla Glue #4) X
Purple Dragon Strain,"Purple Dragon is a mixture of Blue Dragon, a sativa-indica hybrid, and Purple Urkle, a powerful indica favorite. The exact balance of indica and sativa is unclear, but it's known to be indica-dominant, producing calming but euphoric high with happiness, drowsiness, and powerful hunger. The effects start in the head and then move to the body. THC levels are very high, at least 21% in publicly available lab results. Surprisingly, then, CBD levels are also relatively high, between 1% and 2%. That means Purple Dragon may be useful in the treatment of seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to CBD. It's also recommended for treating anxiety, low mood, physical fatigue, inflammation, migraine headaches, mood disorders, chronic pain, and insomnia. Both the flavor and smell of this strain contain notes of flowers, sage, and spice, while the buds have a combination of purple, green, and orange hues. Dry mouth is the only widely reported negative effect from using Purple Dragon, though dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia are also possible. Though it isn't on many top 10 lists, this strain sells fairly well in Arizona, California, Washington State, and British Columbia."
Dutch Crunch Strain,"With origins in Holland and California, Dutch Crunch is a delightful combination of the sativa Jack Herer and Dutch Treat, a popular indica-dominant hybrid. It has a sativa/indica ratio of 20:80, so the body effects dominate. THC concentrations have been measured at greater than 21%, making this an especially potent medical choice. CBD levels, on the other hand, are less than 2%, so this isn't recommended as a treatment for epilepsy or other diseases that respond to CBD. The body buzz is powerful and calming, leading to a deeply relaxed experience. It's best saved for late at night or rainy days. Dutch Crunch can be used to relieve the symptoms of fatigue, pain, and anxiety, while it's also a good appetite stimulant for patients who need to gain weight. Expect a smooth pine flavor and a fruity, minty pine smell. Negative effects aren't widely reported, but likely include cottonmouth and dry eyes. Unlike its parents, Dutch Crunch isn't widely sought by patients, but it can provide effective relief to many. It's probably most common on legal markets in Amsterdam and California."
Green Crack Extreme Strain,"Green Crack Extreme is a sativa dominant strain with a 35:65 indica/sativa ratio. Apart from being around for two whole decades, it is quite popular amongst medical marijuana users. It was formerly known as Crush and is quite potent considering its amazing 24% THC content. The buds are beautiful nonetheless, covered with orange hairs and crystals. But what set it apart from the rest of the crowd are its dense and thick buds. As for the taste and aroma, it is fruity and extremely sweet. After giving it a smoke, you will realize it is extremely smooth on the inhale and exhale.

Special Queen Strain,"This near-even hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of 50:50) is a mix of Power Bud and Skunk, both popular medical selections. It has moderate THC levels, between 14% and 16% in available samples, making it a great choice for first-time patients and occasional tokers. CBD levels are unclear, but reports suggest the chemical is too scarce to recommend Special Queen for treatment of conditions that respond to CBD, such as pediatric seizure disorders. The strain is good, however, as a medication for anxiety, sleeplessness, and chronic nerve pain. The indica-driven effects are mostly physical, producing a calming, happy body high with accompanying mental relief. Special Queen has a musky, Skunky flavor, and it smells of citrus and tealeaves. The buds have a lime green hue and brown hairs. There aren't many public reports of side effects associated with this strain, but it's probably safe to expect watery eyes and cottonmouth, as well as possible paranoia. Though relatively rare, Special Queen can be purchased on the medical markets of California, Arizona, and Colorado, and in limited parts of Europe. Some black market breeders may grow it, but not enough to make it a regular find there."

Almost each and every detail is visible to the naked eye, which makes it more appealing than it already is. As for the taste and smell, it is not as distinct as you would have thought it to be.

The strain is perfect for individuals looking for something to elevate their mood with. You will immediately notice symptoms of euphoria all the while feeling extremely energetic at the same time.

If you can, it may be useful in relieving insomnia, anxiety, mood disorders, PTSD, ADHD, and stomach problems. Dry mouth is likely, while dry eyes and paranoia are possible but less likely. The indica genes are dominant in this plant, but it's unclear exactly how dominant they are; Royal Cheese has a 25:75 sativa/indica ratio, while Hash Plant has a 20:80 ratio.

These effects make Oakland OG perfect for treating conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, fatigue, and mild to moderate cases of depression."
Butterscotch Strain,"Butterscotch is a medical Indica strain that is said to have an aroma unlike any others. The smell of actual butterscotch can be scented when a bag or container of this strain containing 18.47% THC is opened. The buzz you are going to get is classically Indica: Body-sedating and mind-calming. Medical patients use butterscotch mostly to alleviate the symptoms of anxiety, PMS, appetite loss, and insomnia. Strictly an Indica strain, its sedative effects are totally supreme and a couchlock can potentially be induced, which may not be a bad thing at the end of a stressful and busy week at work. Not recommended for use during the day as a medicinal smoke because the effects are so weighty. With a lovely orange color that is almost too pretty, and an aroma match with its namesake ice cream topping, the only downsides said to occur from this strain include the commonly expected dizziness, dry eyes, and dry mouth."
Jack Flash Strain,"Jack Flash is an indica-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ration of 70:30) with THC levels reaching as high as 20%. That makes this a very potent strain for patients seeking a body high with psychedelic effects and a euphoric boost. This plant, which won the Dutch High Life Cup in 1998, is a hybrid of the sativa Jack Herer, the indica Super Skunk, and Haze, itself a sativa. It's best known for the speed of the high, which hits almost instantly, a result of this strain's Jack Herer genetics. While THC levels are high, CBD levels are something of a mystery: This definitely isn't recommended as a CBD strain, but the exact percentage of CBD is unknown. Jack Flash smells of earth and citrus and has a sweet flavor. The high is multi-faceted, with deep body relaxation, euphoria, energy, and creativity, along with a strong happy feeling. It provides relief to patients suffering from anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. It's also good for ADHD, anorexia nervosa, and migraines. Negative effects are limited to a relatively slim possibility of dry mouth or dry eyes. Dizziness is possible but unlikely. This strain may be hard to find outside the American West, but it's fairly popular in California and Colorado."
Space Cake Strain,Space Cake is a rare slightly indica dominant hybrid strain (65% indica/35% sativa) created through crossing the infamous

Bad Azz Kush Strain,Bad Azz Kush is a potent indica dominant strain created through a powerful three-way cross of the infamous
Critical Neville Haze Strain,"THC levels are high in this tropical sativa, topping 24% in some tests. That makes for a potent head high with energizing effects. Euphoria is strong, along with happiness. Critical Neville Haze is a useful medical tool in treating anxiety, depression, and general life stress. The indica genes may also provide some physical pain relief. It's not clear exactly what percentage of this strain is sativa, but the indica genes are definitely in the minority. This strain has a woody taste and aroma with coffee flavoring. Negative effects aren't entirely clear, but they likely include cottonmouth and red eyes. Don't look to Critical Neville Haze for CBD; those levels are very low, making this a less-than-ideal treatment for conditions that respond to that chemical. This strain is a cross between Neville Haze, a sativa-dominant hybrid, and Critical Bilbo, an indica-dominant hybrid. Despite its illustrious heritage, Critical Neville Haze is not a particularly popular strain. It's probably easiest to buy on medical markets in the American West or in Europe, but details of its availability are very hard to come by."
Halley's Comet Strain,"Halley's Comet, also known as “Haley's Comet,” is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid strain (60% sativa/40% indica) created through crossing the classic"
Purple Queen Strain,Purple Queen is a rare indica dominant hybrid strain (70% indica/30% sativa) created through crossing the infamous

El Diablo OG Strain,"Also known simply as Diablo OG, is named after the Spanish word for ""the devil."" It isn't exactly that, but it's definitely an effective medical strain. THC concentration can reach 20%, while CBD levels are less than 1%, making this a less-than-ideal choice for treating seizures or other conditions that respond to this cannabinoid. El Diablo OG has a sativa-to-indica ratio of 60:40, so the high is largely cerebral, with clear-headed effects, a strong dose of euphoria, and a moderate body buzz. Medically speaking, this strain is helpful with chronic pain, anxiety, insomnia, and migraine headaches. Dry mouth, as usual, is the most common side effect. Dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia are also possible, though less likely. El Diablo descends from OG Kush, one of the world's best-known strains, Blueberry, Grapefruit, and an unknown African plant. The resulting flavors taste of the soil and grapefruit, combined with a pungent plant's aroma. The appearance usually has a middle-of-the-road green hue. This strain is very popular but unfortunately, rather hard to find. It's most common in California, Oregon, Arizona, and Colorado. It can be found on the black market, and it's worth trying if it comes around."
The Sweeties Strain,The Sweeties is a rare indica dominant hybrid strain (70% indica/30% sativa) created through crossing the classic
Rainbow Strain,"THC values in this especially powerful strain can top 22%, while CBD numbers are much lower. That cannabinoid makes up about 0.49% of this strain, which means it probably shouldn't be used to treat seizures without other, more effective medication. But it's a highly versatile medical tool and can be used to treat both mental and physical disorders: anxiety, depression, PMS, GI distress, migraines and other headaches, muscle spasms, nausea, and pain. Rainbow is an indica-heavy hybrid with a sativa/indica balance of 20:80, the result of a cross between Blueberry and Dance Hall. The high, often quite strong, creates a happy case of the giggles, a tingly sensation, and a potent dose of euphoria. The aroma is sweet, as is the taste, with hints of flowers and honey. Rainbow gets its name from its multi-colored nugs, which are covered in a glossy layer of trichomes. It sells best on the legal medical markets in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Montana. It may also appear on the black market, but it isn't very common in most places. This strain may cause dry mouth and dry eyes, while paranoia and dizziness are also reported."

Super Lemon Skunk Strain,"THC levels are high in this indica strain, topping 21% in some tests. CBD contents, meanwhile, are much lower, less than 1%. It's not clear where this indica-dominant strain came from, or what its parents were, or even how much of it is indica and how much sativa. But the effects follow the indica genes, producing a spacey, sleepy effect that induces deep relaxation. Super Lemon Skunk is an effective medical choice for patients who want to relieve chronic pain and alleviate insomnia. It's less effective for patients who need CBD treatment, including those with seizure disorders. This strain has a sweet lemony flavor, with a similar smell. The real selling point of Super Lemon Skunk, though, is its potency, with a high that can last as long as four hours. Side effects are largely unknown, though it's a safe bet that dry mouth is among them. This strain is sold in at least one Colorado medical marijuana dispensary, but it could be difficult to find in other parts of the country. It's probably more common on the medical market than the black market."

Named for its insanely delicious flavor, this gorgeous bud will have you begging for more after just one toke. White Cherry Truffle tastes exactly how it sounds – like sweet cherries and chocolate. The aroma takes on a slightly spicier, more pungent turn with sweet cherries and chocolate accented by diesel and earth and a touch of fresh rose. The White Cherry Truffle high is perfect for any hybrid lover, with full-bodied effects that will have you kicking back in no time at all. It starts in the head with a stoney lifted euphoria that quickly spreads from limb to limb, settling you down into a deeply relaxing and slightly sedative body stone, a state that often ends in sleep. Thanks to these effects and its high 15-25% average THC level, White Cherry Truffle is often chosen to treat chronic pain, migraines or headaches, depression, insomnia and mood swings. This bud has small dense forest green nugs with light purple undertones, bright orange hairs and a coating of tiny bright white crystal trichomes."
Ben Franklin OG Strain,"Ben Franklin OG, also known simply as “Franklin OG” or “The Franklin,” is an indica dominant hybrid strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and general disagreement about its backstory. Nonetheless, this presidential bud is sought after for its relaxing yet arousing effects that can leave you tingly and active although slightly sedated. The high starts with a warming body buzz and a lifted mood that’s accompanied by a sense of subtle energy. This buzz fades into a calm state that’s slightly sedated with a pretty heavy sleepy feeling despite an active mind. Because of these effects and its medium THC level, Ben Franklin OG is said to be perfect for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress, depression, insomnia, appetite loss, and chronic pain. This bud has flat heart-shaped forest green nugs that are completely oversized and covered in thin clear hairs and clear crystal trichomes. The Ben Franklin OG aroma is very pungent and sour yet somehow sweet and fruity with a harsh diesel effect that’s released as the nugs are burned. The taste is of sweet fruit with a hint of pungent citrus and berry that stays on your tongue long after you finish smoking."
Neptune Kush Strain,"Neptune Kush is a 100% pure indica with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and general disagreement within the cannabis community about its origins. Although it is widely agreed that this classic strain descends from the OG Kush family, its cross-parentage is still widely debated. This dank bud boasts a moderate THC level that ranges from 17-19% on average and a myriad of indica effects. Users describe the Neptune Kush high as a creeper. A warming numbing body buzz will slowly creep up on you until you suddenly realize that you are completely stoned in mind and body, leaving you utterly sedated and completely at ease. This potent buzz offers substantial pain relief and typically ends in deep and peaceful sleep. Due to these potent effects, Neptune Kush is said to be an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress or anxiety, mild to moderate cases of depression, and sleep disorders, including insomnia and night terrors. These nugs have a pungent honey aroma and a taste of pungently sweet honey vanilla. Neptune Kush has oversized dense spade-shaped light minty green nugs with a spattering of dark orange hairs and rich gold undertones. These nugs are completely frosted with sugary white trichomes and dripping with super sticky resin."
African Tangie Strain,African Tangie is a super rare evenly balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain created through crossing the classic
Exodus Cheese Strain,"Exodus is a sativa dominant strain and is a cross between Skunk and Cheese. With a 40:60 indicia/ sativa ratio it creates an impressive 18% THC level and packs quite a punch. Keeping this in mind, it is quite potent and is not recommended to first time medical marijuana users. The name itself explains its aroma as it smells like mature cheddar and is carried over into the flavor as well. The smell will no doubt stink up the place and the taste is quite terrible as it is earthy, mossy with pine undertones. But if you do plant to smoke this strain, it would be a good idea to do so in the night. Exodus Cheese is one of those strains provides a damp aftertaste. After smoking the strain, you will feel a sedating stoner feeling set in. It is one of the reasons why patients prefer it and also because it is effective at treating several medical conditions including anorexia, depression, stress and chronic aches. However, you have to make sure you smoke the right dose in order to avoid experiencing dry mouth and dry eyes. But then again, its pros outweigh its cons."

The strain provides a warm, mellow high which can last around 2-3 hours depending on how much is smoked. For some the buzz that this strain provides is not as high as other strains.

The appearance of this strain is exactly like the name suggests blue. It is extremely blue with some white texture. The blueberry yum yum is extremely aromatic and smells fruity. The taste is similar to the smell meaning blueberry is the dominant taste with other lighter fruity undertones."

OG Poison Strain,"This strain is anything but poison. OG Poison is a potent indica-dominant hybrid bred specifically to fight insomnia. It hits hard and fast, inducing sleep in even the most tightly wound users. The genetics aren't clear, but presumably it contains genes from both OG Kush and Durban Poison, both longtime favorites among patients. This strain has a sativa/indica ratio of roughly 30:70, so the indica side definitely wins out. THC levels can be unusually high, with a maximum of about 22% in tests. CBD content is higher than usual, but not necessarily enough to recommend this as a treatment for seizures of other disorders that respond to that cannabinoid. Expect a focused, calming body high that may induce sleep. That makes it a good choice for insomnia, though it's also recommended for treatment of anxiety, nausea, and headaches, including migraines. Dry eyes and dry mouth are the most common side effects, while headaches and paranoia are more rare. OG Poison has a pungent, woody aroma with a hint of pine and a similar flavor. This strain isn't especially common or popular, but it's found most often in Los Angeles and Arizona."
Ed Rosenthal Super Bud Strain,"Ed Rosenthal Super Bud is not your average cannabis strain. Even though it is an indica dominant strain (60:40 indica/ sativa ratio) it offers a spectacular 19% THC content. The strain was named after the prominent cannabis guru and elitist. Its effects vary primarily because of its combination of sativa and indica effects. The strain looks unusual and is in the form of a Manila oxidized cream. It tastes smooth with a hint of hash. As for the smell, it is incredibly sweet. Since the strain is a full melt, it can be a little difficult to work with. After smoking the strain, you will begin to experience a numbing body high. Beginners may feel extremely tired and sleepy due to this reason entirely. On the other hand, it does offer a cerebral high that will make you feel euphoric and creative at the same time. But then again, smoking larger doses of the strain does have its drawbacks including cotton mouth, dry eyes, paranoia and headaches. Ed Rosenthal is perfect for evening time use and can be used to treat a variety of different medical conditions including depression, stress, chronic pains, aches, nausea and loss of appetite as well."
Firewalker OG Strain,"Firewalker OG is a sativa dominant hybrid. It is a cross between Skywalker and Fire OG and has a spectacular 22% THC content with buds that are not meant for the faint of heart. Upon closer inspection, the buds reveal themselves as quite dense and hard at the same time. The strain has a blocky structure and has rich trichome coverage. The strain has a kush scent with floral and perfume undertones. However, you will also notice hints of chem/fuel sharpness that add to the complexity of its smell. As for the taste, it is no different from its smell. It is a hard-hitting strain that is spicy with a non-aggressive kush flavor. As soon as you smoke the strain, you will feel lightheaded. You will feel your mind and senses awaken and will find it easier to concentrate and focus on the task at hand. The strain successfully provides the energy you require for the remainder of the day, thus making it an ideal strain for daytime use.

William's Wonder Strain,"Many people assume William's Wonder is named after Willie Nelson! This country legend is well known for his liking of marijuana. Whether it is or not still is a mystery, but this strain of marijuana is also a well-known legend. This is a type you must try to really appreciate. It is 100% Indica. The plants grow large with colorful yellow, red, and green flowers. William's Wonder offers a diverse scent that is a cross between citrus and tropical fruits. The taste is both sweet and sour. Since the 1980's, this has been a very popular strain because of the potency and great taste. It isn't one to start out with though so those new to using marijuana may want to work up to it. The THC level is about 26%. This type of marijuana is best used at the end of the day. Most users find it quickly encompasses them and they will drift off to sleep.

Neither are the typical amounts of THC or CBD in Red Raspberry Kush, though reviews and user reports suggest it's a rather potent medical option. It's a crossbreed of Raspberry Cough and Cheese, two very popular strains available on both the medical and recreational markets. The taste and smell have sweet hints of raspberry, along with grape, other fruit, and Skunk. The bud has a speckled light-and-dark-green appearance with dark brown hairs. Red Raspberry Kush may be used to treat the symptoms of fatigue, depression, anxiety, and chronic bodily pain. The high it produces is a mix of head and body effects, calming yet energized, euphoric yet focused. It's an intensely uplifting and happy experience. There aren't many available reports on this strain's likely negative effects, but it's a safe bet that cottonmouth, watery eyes, and paranoia are among them. Look for Red Raspberry Kush on the legal markets of Oregon or, occasionally, on the black market. It's something of a regional specialty but not terribly hard to find."

All Star Jack Frost Strain,All Star Jack Frost is a slightly sativa dominant (65% sativa/35% indica) strain created by breeders at the world-famous Berkley Patients Group in California. This potent strain is a cross between the hugely popular
Amsterdam OG Strain,"Amsterdam OG may not be the best weed ever to come out of that city, but it's a pleasant choice for smokers looking to alleviate stress and pain. The origins of this European strain are unclear, but the sativa/indica ratio is 20:80, so this is definitely a body-centric strain. With THC levels that can exceed 18%, this is fairly potent strain; it's not the strongest strain, but it's more than strong enough for many patients. But don't use Amsterdam OG for its CBD content, as it makes up less than 1% of the plant. Instead, this strain is good for treating chronic body pains, inflammation, insomnia, and anxiety. The high is strong and physical, with a calming body buzz and a shot of happiness. Amsterdam OG has a fresh smell, with sweet notes of perfume. Likewise, it tastes of sweet perfume. Expect limited side effects, including bloodshot eyes and cottonmouth. This strain might appear at select U.S. dispensaries, but it's much more common in its namesake city. It's worth trying if it shows up on a local market, legal or black, but it's not especially popular."
Bubba Jones Strain,"Fact about Bubba Jones aren't easy to find, but it's known to be a potent cross of the sativa-dominant Casey Jones and Bubba Kush, an indica-heavy favorite. The ratio of sativa to indica in this strain isn't widely known. Nor is there much information about the levels of THC and CBD in Bubba Jones. But the high combines mental and physical effects, an indication that this strain may have a nearly even mix of sativa and indica genes. The effects include a pleasant, calming body buzz and an energized, euphoric cerebral rush. That makes Bubba Jones a good choice for treating anxiety, depression, chronic pain, insomnia, and everyday stress. Without more information on CBD contents, though, this strain isn't recommended as a primary treatment for conditions that respond to that chemical, including seizure disorders. The smell and taste of this strain are decidedly Skunky, with a smooth flavor. The bud has a chunky, light green appearance under a frosting of trichomes. Dry mouth and dry eyes are likely side effects, though reports are few and far between; dizziness and paranoia may also occur."
Earth Shaker Strain,"The strain has been named as such for good reason: it is an indica dominant hybrid strain with an 80:20 indica/sativa ratio. The strain is renowned for its high levels of THC content which is no less than 25%. The buds are quite unique and fluffy but equally dense as well. However, the nuggets are frosty and quite light with rich trichome coverage. The aroma does not necessarily appeal to everyone, as it is mild with cheese undertones. But it does more than make up for its scent with its taste. It offers a spectacular blend of herbal and lemon flavors with hints of hash. The strain offers a body buzz rather than a cerebral one. However, you have to keep in mind that it is a creeper nonetheless. The high will hit you when you least expect it and when it does, you will feel extremely tired and sleepy. It is strong enough to knock you out for the rest of the night. But then again, you will feel relaxed and calm, making it an ideal strain for anyone who is depressed or under a lot of stress. But that is not all, as it is just as effective at treating medical conditions like muscle spasms, pains and aches, anxiety and anorexia."
Cripit Strain,"Cripit, also known as Crippled Pit, is a Sativa dominant 80%- 20% hybrid. Its lineage includes Pit Bull and White Rhino (Crippled Rhino), and it was created in 2008.

Patients who are using it report that they are experiencing relief from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), pain, loss of appetite, headaches, and depression. The only negative effects that have been reported are the common dry eyes and dry mouth. The appearance of Cripit is light green with purple infusions. The whitish tinge makes it look to be covered in powdered sugar. It has a sweet, tropical aroma that is quite heady, and the taste of chocolate. Great strain for a smoke in the evening since you can be sure of kicking back and relaxing."
Gooey Wreck Strain,"Trainwreck was crossed with Afgooey to create this sativa-indica hybrid (the exact ratio of sativa to indica is unclear, but it's probably indica-dominant). The bud is reddish brown, with green and a fuzzy layer of trichomes. Gooey Wreck has a citrus aroma and a sweet flavor. It's definitely a rarity, probably found in few places except the West Coast. THC levels are unknown, though this isn't known as the world's most potent strain. CBD levels are likewise a mystery, but there's little evidence that this is an appropriate strain for patients with seizure disorders or other conditions alleviated by CBD. The high from Gooey Wreck is relaxing, with a likely focus on body effects as opposed to cerebral effects. It's apparently best used to treat physical symptoms, including inflammation, migraines, and chronic pain. Adverse effects may include dry eyes and dry mouth, though there are few reports on the subject. It may be possible to find this medical strain in some California dispensaries, but elsewhere it's pretty rare. The Afghani and Haze genes in Gooey Wreck make it a pleasant choice for some patients, but not popular enough to be easy to find."
Empire OG Strain,"Empire OG, described as the perfect strain by I Read Culture's cannabis critics in 2012, is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain that boasts an insanely intense 25-30% THC. This powerful bud is a cross between"

As the high continues, you'll become more and more introspective and philosophical, getting lost further and further within your own mind.

Due to these potent effects, XXX 420 is said to be an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as eye pressure and glaucoma, migraines or tension headaches, and chronic stress or anxiety. XXX 420 buds have an aroma of tropical citrus and a taste of sweet tropical citrus with a hint of pepper. These nugs have large dense forest green spade-shaped leafy nugs with fiery orange hairs and delicious milky white trichomes and resin."
Jack's Haze Strain,"The strain is a cross between Super Silver Haze and Jack Herer. It is a sativa dominant strain with an amazing 20% THC content. With a 20:80 indica/sativa ratio, the strain is not to be taken lightly. Additionally, it is neither recommended to individuals who are new to cannabis. Upon closer inspection, you will come to realize the buds are beautiful and exotic. They are completely different from any other sativa dominant strain you may have medicated with before. The nuggets are small, frosty and dark green in color. But the orange hairs truly make it stand out. As for the aroma, it is lemony, sweet with pine undertones. The taste is no different from its aroma and offers a kick unlike any other. Jack's Haze is incredibly potent and offers a sharp clear headed high which allows you to stay focused and remain energized for the remainder of the day. The effects of the strain last longer than most sativa dominant strains. What is really interesting is that you will feel more creative which is why it is better off being smoked during the day. That being said, the strain is equally effective at treating several medical conditions including depression and anxiety."

People suffering mild to chronic pains such as arthritis pains can also rely on it for curing their problem. Larry OG haze is a good antidote for nausea as well."
Leilani Chow Strain,"Good luck finding much info on where this rare, mellow indica-heavy hybrid sells. If anyone has it, it's probably a legal medical dispensary on the West Coast or in Colorado. Strains sometimes appear in unlikely places, so it's possible Leilani Chow occasionally circulates on the black market, but it definitely doesn't happen very often. The lack of data makes it hard to say how much of this strain is indica and how much of it is sativa, though the indica genes clearly dominate. That's apparent in the physical high, which is both calming and euphoric. It's difficult to know what percentage of Leilani Chow is THC and what percentage is CBD, though based on the lack of information, it's safe to assume CBD levels aren't very high; strains with strong CBD content are usually better known than this. Medical uses include eating disorders, wasting, chronic pain, and sleeplessness. The smell is sweet, like candy, and pleasantly tropical. The taste is also tropical, with spicy undertones. Expect dry eyes and cottonmouth, but beyond that not much is known about this strain's side effects."
Jamaican Lion Strain,"The Jamaican Lion strain has won the award of second best of all CBD strains. It is a sativa dominant strain with a very rich CBD hybrid. It is a cross between the Mountain Lion and the Jamaican sativa commonly known as a Yarder. It has a comparatively low THC level of 9.0%.

It has been quite a popular choice as it has a calming effect without slowing down the functionality of the person."
Mendo Afgoo Strain,"This strain of marijuana was named after a combination of Mendocino and Afghan with gooey. It gives a mellow but satisfactory feeling to the smoker, which can last for a while. The hybrid is made up of big nugs that are in the shape of blades. The buds are light green with sticky pistils (hence the gooey). Crystals cover the surface of the strain. The Mendo Afgoo energizes the body and vitalizes the mind. The whole body buzzes as the person takes a toke of the weed. Then calmness prevails over the smoker and they go into a couch lock.

Fortune Spicy Disco is a hard-hitting indica cannabis strain with a THC content of 22% and is quite rare to come across. As the name implies, it has plenty to offer and will make your efforts worth it if you get your hands on this strain in particular.

Bazooka Joe Strain,"If this strain brings to mind the popular, rock-hard gum, it's not accident, as Bazooka Joe the marijuana smells and tastes distinctly of bubblegum. There are also sweet candy notes in both the flavor and aroma. The effects are modest, as this strain has THC levels between 13% and 15% in some tests.

Private Reserve Hyper Blue Strain,"This select, rare strain is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an unknown sativa/indica ratio. But it's known to have highly potent THC levels, between 24% and 25% in some tests. CBD levels are less clear, but as a sativa, Private Reserve Hyper Blue most likely has very little of it. So this strain isn't recommended for seizures or other conditions that are alleviated with CBD. The cerebral effects border on hallucinogenic, with strong psychoactive tendencies. Creativity, energy, euphoria, and happiness are all common. The medical properties of this strain make it an effective option for treating anxiety, depression, mood disorders, PMS cramps, inflammation, migraine headaches, and nausea.

With original Afghani and Pakistani parents, Pez boasts THC levels between 15% and 20%, though some samples have tested above 23%. CBD is much, much lower, too low to make this a good choice for treating epilepsy and other conditions that require that chemical. The flavor, like the smell, is sweet, though it also includes notes of flowers and fruit. The nugs are light green with orange hairs and a decent layer of crystals. Patients can expect dry mouth and red eyes, which are typically the most common negatives associated with marijuana, but there are few public reports on the subject. Pez the marijuana strain is much less popular than Pez the candy, though it does fairly well. It sells best in Washington and California."

The taste is fresh and is also reminiscent of diesel. THC is relatively abundant in this strain, topping 17% in at least one publicly available test. But CBD is very low, less than 1%, meaning Sour Willie isn't the best choice for treating seizures or other conditions that respond to CBD. Its best medical uses include treatment for anxiety, depression, mood disorders, glaucoma and ocular pressure, fatigue, migraines, and other headaches. Despite the sativa dominance, Sour Willie produces a high that hits both the body and the mind.

Very little is known about the background but it is safe to say that it has both Indica and Sativa traits. The high is quite unlike anything you will have ever experienced either. While it may start off on the slow side, as time passes it just gets stronger and stronger. In the beginning it is cerebral and blissful, then it finishes off as euphoric and intense. For patients looking to medicate, this strain is tops when it comes to pain relief throughout the body. A color kaleidoscope is the best description of its appearance, and the taste is organic/earthy/sometimes licorice. It is very smooth to inhale and has an aroma of earth mixed with unique floral."
Chem Jack Strain,"Chem Jack is a sativa dominant hybrid strain which is a cross between Jack Herer and Chem D. The strain has a 35:65 indica/sativa ratio and it borrows extensively from its parentage. Chem Jack has an astounding 27% THC content and it produces amazing buds. Most of the buds are light green in color and are covered with brown hairs. As for the smell and taste, they are just about the same. The strain mostly has a sweet and earthy smell but with earthy undertones. However, its taste is a bit piney and leaves a pleasant aftertaste in the mouth for you to enjoy. The effects of the strain are productive and energetic. You will be able to focus and concentrate on things more easily. What is truly amazing about the strain is it promotes a mellow mood and complex thinking. Chem Jack is a perfect daytime strain and may just be what you need to get yourself on track at work. Considering its uplifting effects, Chem Jack proves to be a delightful strain. On the other hand, it is quite effective at treating severe medical conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety and even depression."
Platinum Champagne Strain,"Platinum Champagne is a potent pure sativa strain (sativa/indica ratio of 100:0). It comes covered in a thick layer of resinous trichome crystals, and the nugs are dense, with light green leaves and orange hairs. The smell and flavor are sweet with hints of fruit. This strain is a rather obscure medical choice, good for treating anxiety, migraine headaches, and nausea. The sativa head high is clear headed and energetic, with a boost of creativity and a happy dose of euphoria. It's hard to say how much THC can be found in this strain, as few tests are publicly available, but Platinum Champagne is rumored to be quite powerful. It isn't known to contain large amounts of CBD, however, and that fact recommends against using this strain to medicate conditions that require CBD extracts, such as severe seizure disorders. Negative side effects are likely to include dry mouth and red eyes, though there's little reliable information to go by. Platinum Champagne was born outside San Diego and can still be purchased in California, but elsewhere it's much more difficult to find."
Mile High Purps Strain,"The strain is an indica dominant hybrid with an astounding 22% THC content. It is a cross between Grape Ape and Purple Kush with an 80:20 indica/sativa ratio. The buds are extremely purple and can easily be confused to be black in color. The strain is exotic and is visually appealing. As for the taste and aroma it is quite different from any other cannabis strain you already may have medicated with before. Not only is it quite similar to how berry wine would smell or taste like, but it is a perfect mixture of apple, spice and woody flavors that will keep you coming back for more. Mile High Purps is not to be taken lightly. It goes without saying it is one of the best indica dominant strains available to the general public. Even though it offers a cerebral high, you stay clear headed at all times. Additionally, you will feel euphoric, energetic and happy without any of the usual drawbacks that is to be expected of smoking too much of an indica dominant strain. Essentially, the Mile High Purps is just as effective at relieving symptoms of nausea, migraine, anxiety and even depression."
Chocolate Bubba Jones Strain,"The chocolate bubba jones strain is described as an indica dominant hybrid. When smoked, it hits hard and can be said to have medium-high potency. It provides a very uplifted, energetic, slightly euphoric high that boosts happiness and creativity. The strain is used mostly for stress relief among patients although it does have other uses that include, but are not limited to, the alleviation of anxiety, pain and depression. Although dry-mouth is the most common negative effect, dry eyes and headaches are also complained about. It is also used to recover ones appetite. It is amongst one of the many strains used primarily for calming the mind and helps the smoker to combat insomnia (If one does indeed suffer from the ailment). Aromatically this strain is average. The most dominant smell is, as the name would suggest of chocolate with earthy and slightly sweet undertones. It also has similarities to many kush strains in terms smell. Upon inhalation, the only taste is a medium hint of chocolate. The smoke however is extremely smooth. Upon close inspection, one can easily see the light green, and at places orange-yellow, appearance with a snowy white texture. This texture is also attributed to the fact that the strain is often sugar coated."
Gravity OG Strain,"Gravity OG is indica dominant hybrid strain and it has a 90:10 indica/sativa ratio. Little is known about the strain and its heritage but one thing is for certain: it is not for the faint of heart. With an amazing 27% THC content it produces lush green buds with red hairs seeping through the surface. The nuggets are tight and dense and have relatively good trichome coverage. The taste and smell are what truly sets this strain apart from the rest of the crowd. It has a musky citrus scent with a nutty, rotten grapefruit flavor which is mouthwatering to say the least. One of the best things about this strain is that it offers a sensational high. Considering its body numbing effects, it will put you to sleep in no time. The effects tend to last longer and will keep you medicated for long. You may even feel euphoric and happy which is why it is often recommended to patients suffering from stress, depression and anxiety. The body buzz is great and can help you accomplish some of your daily tasks to a certain extent but that depends on how much of the strain you have already consumed. On the other hand, it does have other applications and can also be used to treat individuals suffering from mood disorders, anorexia and muscle spasms."
IE CC Skywalker Strain,"IE CC Skywalker originates from the San Bernadino region and is a hybrid marijuana strain. It has an OG lineage. IE CC Skywalker is an Indica dominant strain that has hints of the Sour Diesel strain as well. It has a good potency so the THC level is assumed to be moderate. The strain has dense and sticky buds with a light green color and is covered with orange hairs. It produces a powerful body buzz that is quite long lasting.

White Dawg Fire OG Strain,"White Dawg Fire OG is a sativa dominant hybrid (70% sativa/30% indica) strain created by breeders at the infamous Ivita Wellness Center in Denver, Colorado as a potent cross between the powerful"
Grape Moonshine Strain,"Grape Moonshine is the result of the Bubba Band crossed with the cannabis strains Grape Ape. Patients residing at Nature's Alternative Care are being offered Moonshine Grape. The amazing buzz and tantalizing aroma make Grape Moonshine a popular strain choice. The parent Bubba Band contains Headband and its sativa traits really pop from the indica-heavy genetics of this strain. A look of Bubba Band is apparent on the buds and they comprise of changing tones of orange and light green hairs. The nugs of this strain give off a dominant scent of grape. The rich and deep flavor of this strain is appealing for many users. Grape Moonshine is typically an indica-dominant strain and is quite effective as nighttime medication. This specific marijuana strain is useful for medical cannabis patients who are fighting arthritis, anxiety, migraines, muscle spasms and insomnia. In addition to this, the Grape Moonshine strain also induces sleep in a person, thus proving to be beneficial for insomnia patients."
Girl Scout Cookies: Fox Cut Strain,"Being an indica dominant hybrid, the strain has a 60:40 indica/sativa ratio. Not only does it have an impressive 24% THC content but it has plenty to offer apart from an amazing high. The strain is a cross between F1 Durban and OG Kush. Girl Scout Cookies look exceptionally frosty and are quite hard. The buds are dark green in color with hues of blues, black and purples all coming through at the same time. It has a rich aroma that is more or less the same as OG Kush but without the lemon scent. The taste is unlike anything other strain you have medicated with before, it is not only unique but it is minty with chocolate undertones. That being said, you need to keep in mind that this strain is not to be reckoned with. Additionally, it is not recommended to individuals who have started smoking cannabis for the first time. Its effects are incredibly narcotic and you will be baked in no time that is for certain. The high is mostly cerebral and is perfect for those wish to enhance their concentration or focus. But consuming too much of the strain can knock you out for good if you are not careful. On the other hand, the strain is equally effective at treating medical conditions like insomnia, muscle spasms, anorexia and stress."
Cannatonic #7 Strain,"This strain is bred specifically for its high CBD content, which makes it a great treatment for seizures, inflammation, and pain. The CBD level in Cannatonic is about 9%; the THC content is similar. This strain delivers a high, but not a fairly weak one. It's best for physical pain, mood disorders, and anxiety than it is for euphoria or creativity. Like the original Cannatonic, this strain is a cross of an MK Ultra mother and a male G13 Haze plant. The ratio of sativa to indica is 25:75, so the high – what there is – is mostly body-oriented (the ratio in the original Cannatonic is 50:50). Cannatonic #7 has a fresh but pungent pine aroma; it tastes of pine. Medical uses include GI distress, muscle spasms, nausea, and epilepsy. It's prized for its high CBD content, though the THC level is too high for use in children with seizure disorders. Dry mouth isn't unheard of, but negative effects are rare, making this a good strain for those with low tolerance for side effects. Cannatonic #7 is most popular on the West Coast, in Canada, and in Michigan. It's much harder to find on the black market."
Cherry Lime Rickey Strain,"The cherry lime rickey is a unique hybrid cannabis strain. It is neither a sativa or indica strain since its sativa/indica ration is 60:40. The hybrid strain is a result of crossing the Cherry lime haze and sweet cross strain. It is just slightly more towards the sativa side given its slightly skewed ratio. It should be noted that this is a rare clone only strain and cannot be found naturally. It has very high THC, CBN and CBD levels (26.76, 1.13 and 3.95% respectively). The only confirmed medicinal use of this strain is the treatment of various types of anxieties and depression. The high achieved is mellow in the beginning but as more smoke is inhaled, it makes the smoker feel relaxed and provides an elated feeling of happiness. The only distinguishable aroma of the cherry lime rickey is, as the name suggests, of cherry. When inhaled, the smoke is warm and smooth. The taste is mostly fruity. It feels like one is slurping down iced cherry smoothie (without the guilt). The appearance of this the cherry lime rickey is nothing spectacular. It is simply a swampy shade of green with little or no texture."
Kurple Fantasy Strain,"Kurple Fantasy is an indica dominant strain (80:20 indica / sativa ratio) with an impressive 23% THC content and 0.7% CBD levels. The buds show off incredible hues of purple while being covered by crystal trichomes. It has been speculated that the strain is a cross between Purple Urkle and OG Kush, but it cannot be said for certain as its lineage is lost to history. That being said, it is extremely potent and tastes and smells like grapes and blueberries. The strain is a bit of a creeper. Its effects start creeping from the back of your head until it makes its way behind your eyes. This feeling and sensation can last for a couple of minutes before it is dispersed into a euphoric body buzz that will relax your body. It is perfect for patients who are using such a strain for the very first time. You will eventually feel as though you are floating until you begin zoning out. A few bowls of this strain is more than enough to knock you out, which is why it is recommended for night time use. It is also perfect for individuals suffering from nausea, stress and anxiety."
Nite Life Strain,"Take the name of this indica-dominant hybrid literally: Nite Life is a great strain for relaxing and sleeping late at night. The exact balance of sativa and indica isn't clear, as the genetics of this strain are obscure at best. Nor, for that matter, are the THC or CBD contents of this strain. But Nite Life is known to be rather potent, causing a body-oriented high with intense couch-lock effects. The feeling is predominantly relaxed and sleepy, making this an ideal strain for insomnia and anxiety relief. It's also good at treating muscle spasms and chronic pain. This strain has a unique woody flavor and a pungent, earthy cheese smell. Patients who suffer from insomnia or other sleep disorders may find great comfort in Nite Life's calming physical effects. On the other hand, this isn't a very good strain for daytime activities. It might be found on some legal markets in the American West, but very few dispensaries appear to sell it. It would be an even greater challenge to buy it off the black market, especially from local growers."
Don Cristo's Brainfreeze Strain,"Being a hybrid strain, Don Cristo's Brainfreeze is not a force to be reckoned with. Even though it is the predecessor of Don Cristo, it has plenty to offer in terms of an all-time high. The strain will not disappoint, that is for certain. With 21% THC content, the strain produces average buds that are not as exquisite or beautiful as other hybrid strains. They are usually brown in color with orange hairs and gold hues that might appeal to some individuals. The strain got its name for good reason, it is primarily because it delivers a sensation blend of tobacco and cigar flavors for those who are particularly fond of the two. The strain and its high are not extraordinary but it makes the best use of its indica/sativa heritage so that you can enjoy the best of both worlds. The strain is not a creeper, you will feel high in a minute or so but its effects will make you feel sleepy. This is one of the reasons why you should use it as a nighttime strain. Rest assured, your next day will be wonderful and will leave you feeling energized. Considering its effects, there should be no surprise why Don Cristo's Brainfreeze should not be used to treat nausea, tumors and chronic pains and aches."
Oro OG Strain,"THC levels can exceed 18% in this strain, which is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an unknown balance of sativa and indica. Not much is known about it, though its CBD levels are reportedly very low, less than 1%, which is too low to recommend Oro OG for treatment of health problems that respond to that cannabinoid, such as severe epileptic disorders. The sativa genes lead to a strong cerebral experience mixed with more limited physical qualities. Expect creativity, energy, euphoria, mental focus, and happiness, together with couch-lock effects. These traits make Oro OG an effective tool in the medical treatment of anxiety, low mood, mood disorders, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. The flavor is reportedly spicy, and the nugs are dense and light green with orange hairs, but not much is known about how this strain tastes. There are few patient reports of adverse effects with Oro OG, but as usual, watery eyes, and cottonmouth are probably the most common. Club Oro, a medical marijuana dispensary, was the birthplace of this strain, which can still be found there. But elsewhere Oro OG is a rarity."
CPL Strain,"A genetic combination of an indica heirloom and a Land Race South Asian plant, CPL is a third position winner of the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup. The CPL plant has big hairy nuggets with long pistols and a coating of crystals. Indica dominant with an estimated 80 – 85 % indica, this strain can cure headaches and clear sinus within minutes. It can also relieve pain in tired joints. The strain works great for those who suffer from migraines, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, arthritis, muscle spasms, inflammation, PMS and even cancer. This effective and potent pain reliever has a smooth and rich diesel aroma with fruity undertones. The strain offers a pungent diesel like flavor with hints of fruity sweetness with every draw. A delight for veteran smokers, CPL will give them a strong body buzz. The psychoactive effect stays longer and aids sleep, making it an ideal evening or night time strain. Light smokers looking for effective pain relief can enjoy the calming effect offered by this strain in small doses and benefit from its useful and exclusive medicinal properties."
Purple Dogshit Strain,"Don't let the name fool you; Purple Dogshit is actually a very useful medical strain that can help with anxiety, stress, and depression. Very little is known about this rarity, including its exact genetic balance. But it is known to be an indica-dominant hybrid descended from Dogshit and Purple Urkle. THC levels top out at about 19%, while CBD levels are negligible. Purple Dogshit owes its appearance and its flavor to its Purple heritage. This strain tastes of grape and has a dark purple appearance with flecks of brown, green, and gold. It smells similar to its stinky Dogshit parent, but not nearly so powerful. The high is immediate, with a soothing body buzz. It lasts for up to an hour and a half and provides deep relaxation and stress relief. Along with some mental health disorders, Purple Dogshit is a highly effective treatment for pain and can help insomniacs sleep. Negative effects aren't well-documented, tough dry mouth and red eyes are common with almost all marijuana strains. This strain is available on the medical market in Washington State but is rare elsewhere."
Ogre Kush Strain,"Ogre Kush is an indica-dominant strain with a 70/30 ratio and a cross between Master Kush and Bubba Kush. The average THC level observed in Ogre Kush is 13% and CBD level of 0.36%. This strain creates body buzz, feelings of euphoria and drowsiness. Yet, it is a substantial form of calming agent. In terms of flavor, it is a mixture of citrus, earthy and lemon hints. Likewise, it has a mixed and arousing aroma of the same three components. If you are experiencing any one or more of the symptoms such as anxiety, depression, lack of appetite, migraines, pain, seizures, sleeplessness or stress, then this is the perfect strain for you. Ogre Kush must be used during later parts of the day or once you do not have any more tasks. This is because its sleep-inducing and appetite-boosting properties may act as hurdles when you are working. Some of the most prevalent side effects of using this strain are no different from others. You may experience dryness of mouth and eyes, dizziness, paranoia and headaches. Generally, this strain has nine weeks of flowering time and produces high yield at the end of the day."
JR Strain,"JR is also known as Route 66, it is an indica dominant strain with a 75:25 indica/sativa ratio. The strain originates from Northern California and there is very little known about it. What is really interesting is that nobody actually knows who bred it and how it came into being. But one thing is for certain, it offers an exceptional high due to its amazing 17% THC content. The buds are not as dense as other strains you may have come across before. However, it does taste extremely fruity and sweet. After smoking the strain, you will come to realize you are dealing with a one hit wonder. Jolly Rancher is not a creeper and it's a fact (you've been warned). The body high is overwhelming and outdoes its cerebral effects. But you have to keep in mind that the strain is recommended for night time use. You will feel numb and will begin noticing symptoms of couch-lock. But then again it is not as bad as it may seem, as the strain and its effects are just what patients suffering from insomnia and chronic pains/aches need."
Afghani Grand Daddy Strain,"Afghani Grand Daddy is a 100% indica strain. It has an amazing 21% THC content, which should interest most experienced cannabis users. The buds are dense and dark green in color. However, the strain is sticky. Breaking down the buds will make it even stickier than it already was. You will notice purple hues on the stems of the plants. Additionally, the buds are covered by an unusual layer of milky white trichomes. As for the aroma, it is fresh and light. It smells mildly sweet and is quite similar to Grand Daddy Purple in this regard. That being said, it tastes just about the same and will leave a sweet aftertaste in your mouth, which is something to look forward to. The Afghani Grand Daddy has been created using two of the finest indica plants available on the planet. This explains why it has an amazing body buzz with cerebral effects. The high will feel like a warm blanket covering your body. What is really interesting about the strain is that you will remain clear headed throughout the entire duration of the buzz. It tends to be stronger than most indica strains you might have already tried before. But that is not all, as the strain is perfect for treating several medical conditions like anxiety, chronic pains, migraines and even anorexia."
Sour Poison OG Strain,Sour Poison OG is a sativa dominant hybrid (85% sativa/15% indica) strain created by a potent cross between the hugely popular
CCSA Private Reserve OG #1 Strain,"This is the God of pain relief in an Indica dominant medical smoke. Packing your lungs with this will light them up like the fourth of July, but if you can handle it, you will find heaven. This is one strain which is definitely not for the amateur. With an extremely high THC content, it has a pine mixed with wintergreen aroma that is as utterly pleasing as the taste of molasses. Even though no one would call it smooth, its extreme potency makes it a much wanted commodity in the medical marijuana community. Along with being used as a pain reliever, it is also used to relieve stress. Toking on this will make you feel like a desert has invaded your mouth and it will give you a severely debilitating couchlock, but the feeling of peace and tranquility is amazing. The appearance of the nugs are somewhere along the lines of crystallized honey rocks, bearing the color gold. Keep this strain for your after work stash!"
Platinum NASA Strain,"The folks behind the moon landing couldn't have produced a sleepier, more spacey, or more effective combination of Fire OG and San Fernando Valley OG. It's a pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100), and the high shows it. The body buzz is deeply relaxing and comes with intense couch-lock. These effects make Platinum NASA a good choice for treating anxiety, nausea, and chronic pain. CBD and THC numbers are hard to come by, but it's rumored to produce a very potent high. The lack of data on CBD levels means this strain shouldn't be used as the only form of treatment for conditions that require CBD, including epileptic disorders. The nugs of Platinum NASA are bright green with red hairs, while the strain produces a sweet flavor with hints of lemon and spice, and a citrusy pine smell. There are few reliable reports regarding the side effects patients can expect when using this strain, but dry mouth and red eyes are usually the most common, along with paranoia. Platinum NASA is decidedly rare, though it can be found in at least one San Diego medical marijuana dispensary."
Azure Haze Strain,"Azure Haze is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain that is a variant of the hugely popular ""Blue Dream"" (Blueberry X"

White Widow Max Strain,"White Widow max is a slightly indica dominant hybrid (60% indica/40% sativa) strain that is the celebrity child of two infamous cannabis strains,"
Fruit of the Gods Strain,"This divinely inspired medical strain is a sativa-dominant cross of Northern Lights #5, Skunk #1, and Haze, all classics in their own right. The exact ratio of sativa/indica isn't clear, but Fruit of the Gods is probably at least 70% sativa. The THC contents of this strain vary but can reach as high as 21%. Typically for a sativa, CBD levels are very low, too low to recommend this strain to patients who need that form of marijuana treatment. The high is focused on the head, with a strong shot of mood enhancement and a high degree of mental clarity. The dominant feelings in this creeper high are relaxation and happiness. The flavor and aroma of this strain is strongly reminiscent of flowers, with a sweet haze taste. Fruit of the Gods is designed to treat depression, anxiety, fatigue, and chronic body pains. Adverse effects may include dry mouth and dry eyes, while paranoia and other negatives are more limited. Born in Amsterdam, this is a rare strain almost everywhere else, including legal markets in the United States. But the strong cerebral effects of Fruit of the Gods make it a good choice for daytime activities."
Gold Coast Candy OG Strain,"Gold Coast Candy OG may be an indica strain but it is not to be taken lightly. Even though it is potent, it can be used by individuals who are new to smoking cannabis. The strain has a 17% THC content and it may not appeal to most experienced cannabis users but it should not be underestimated in any way. The buds are ordinary and are dense and sticky with gold hues amidst the greens. As for the taste and smell, it is fruity and sweet. The sweet indica strain is known for its mellow effects. It is the perfect strain to medicate with if you do not plan to leave the house. The strain and its effects tend to last longer and will leave you with an exceptional high that is calming to say the least. Apart from that, a hit or two is more than enough to last you a solid hour without breaking a sweat. However, most experienced will need a bit more before they can actually feel the full force of the strain. That being said, it is important to keep in mind that the numbing effects of the strain are perfect for individuals who are suffering from pains, migraines and even nausea."
Crystal Mountain Kush Strain,"Crystal Mountain Kush is a hybrid strain produced by crossing OG Kush and Chem Dawg. The strain's THC content usually varies depending on where it is bought from but it exceeds 20%. The strain produces average buds that do not look like much. They are green in color and have orange hairs seeping through the surface. Additionally, they are fluffy which differentiates the strain from the rest of the hybrid cannabis strains on the market. The taste and smell are no different. However, they are a treat nonetheless. Cannabis users will enjoy a perfect blend of lemon and sour flavors which leaves an exotic aftertaste that lingers in the mouth for quite some time. The strain and its effects start off in the form of a body buzz. However, it is quite calming at the same time. Moreover, some individuals may even feel clearheaded and energized, depending on the usage. You may even get the munchies which is why it would be a good idea to have snacks lying around just in case. The high is strong but it offers mind relief which is perfect for those who have had a horrible. But that is not all, as the strain is effective at treating stress, inflammation, anxiety, and muscle spasms."
Venus OG Strain,"Venus OG is a long-lasting, and very potent hybrid strain of Tahoe Kush and OG Kush. Due to the THC content being around 25%, the effects of consuming this are almost instantaneous. In appearance, the plant has a range of colors that go from forest green to neon green, with very thick and big buds on it. It has a very strong taste, comparable to a lemon, hash, pine, and skunk. Its aroma is interesting, mixing pine and diesel with a lemony undertone that will soak in your nostrils. You can feel your eyes begin to relax, you become very sociable, get increasingly creative, have racing thoughts, etc. After about an hour of that, you start to feel a strong mind and body relaxation which starts and ends with happiness. The effects of this weed can last for around 1.5 hours to 4 hours. The medical uses of this strain are very good as well, being excellent for cancer, bi-polar disorder, ADD/ADHD, anti-social disorders, and depression."
RiNo’s Royal Kush Strain,"RiNo's Royal Kush is a hugely indica dominant hybrid (90% indica/10% sativa) strain created organically by breeders at the infamous RiNo Supply Co. in Denver, Colorado. This dank bud is a potent cross of the insanely popular"
Jack Knife Strain,One of the most beautiful strains of cannabis is Jack Knife. It offers THC of 20% and it is a 70:30 Sativa/Indica product. It is a rare product though and that makes it more expensive. It is a hybrid of Jamaican Pearl and Jack Herer. Jack Knife is very smooth tasting and it is sweet. The taste is almost like refined sugar from candy. The smell is forestry with a hint of pine and eucalyptus. The buds this plant creates are very colorful and the smell is very strong but pleasant. The high from Jack Knife lasts a couple of hours and it is very light. Many people use it to take the edge off due to stress or anxiety.

Blueberry Master P Strain,"Blueberry Master P is a 100% pure indica strain created by breeders at the infamous So Cal Op farm in Tarzana, California. Although its breeders closely guard its genetics, cannabis experts generally agree that it is most likely a crossbreed of"
LSD OG Strain,"With strong psychoactive effects and THC levels topping 24%, LSD OG earns its place alongside the real thing. This is a potent indica-dominant hybrid, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica is hard to come by. The indica genes produce deep-body relaxation and stress relief, together with creative, giggly cerebral effects and even occasional psychedelic effects. LSD OG is best used as treatment for depression, chronic pain, and stress. CBD levels may be higher than average, though it's hard to know for sure. But they likely aren't high enough to recommend this as a front-line treatment for seizures. This strain smells and tastes like lemons, with an additional menthol flavor. Side effects aren't widely reported, probably because this strain isn't sold in many places, but dry mouth and dry eyes are likely the most common. LSD OG is very popular among those who have tried it, but they're few in number. Look for it on the West Coast and possibly in Colorado, but don't expect to find it on the American black market anytime soon. If you do, make sure to try it."
Grape Kush Caviar Strain,Grape Kush Caviar is an indica dominant hybrid strain created through a three-way cross of the powerful
Grand Daddy Urkel Strain,"Grand Daddy Urkel is an indica dominant hybrid strain with a 60:40 indica/sativa ratio and is the finest of its kind. The strain is produced by crossing Urkel with Big Bud. Grand Daddy Urkel has dense buds that are purple in color and rich in trichome coverage. The strain extensively borrows from its heritage and offers a taste and aroma unlike any other. It is a mouthwatering treat, to say the least. Even though the taste and aroma are no different, they offer a unique blend of berry and grape flavors. The strain is potent and offers psychoactive effects and is not limited in any way. As soon as you smoke the strain, you will feel its effects take control of your mind and body. You will be able to experience a perfect fusion of physical relaxation and cerebral euphoria, which is indescribable until or unless you give the strain a try. After a few minutes, you may exhibit symptoms of couch-lock. This is why it would be wise to smoke it before you go to bed. However, the strain is more commonly used for its medical effects as it is able to treat chronic pains and aches, muscle spasms and even loss of appetite."
Blue Vortex Strain,Blue Vortex is a heavily sativa dominant hybrid (90% sativa/10% indica) strain that is a potent cross between the insanely popular
Sour LA Strain,"Sour LA, also more commonly referred to as ""LA Diesel"" among members of the cannabis community, is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid (60% sativa/40% indica) strain created as a potent cross between the insanely popular classic"
Naughty Girl Scout Cookies Strain,"The marijuana culture associated with the concept of Naughty Girl Scout Cookies is not unknown to people who make use of the drug or to people who do not make use of the drug. However, having a strain by that name also implies that the strain is particularly popular and effective just as the origin of the name that it seems to have: Naughty Girl Scout Cookies Strain. It has very calming effects on the human body as it makes you euphoric, happy and very creative. It can calm the necessary parts of your brain, which makes it very effective for treating things such as stress, anxiety and depression of any kind. It also helps you deal with a lack of appetite but in some ways, it can also help you with weight loss situations. It has a sweet woody and piney smell and comes in a large assortment of flavors, which are inclusive of flavors such as chocolate, pine, cherry, etc. The flavor of the Naughty Girl Scout Cookies Strain is a sweet and smooth one. The Naughty Girl Scout Cookies Strain is particularly popular among people dealing with mental health issues."
Black Rain Strain,"Black Rain is a heavily sativa dominant hybrid (90% sativa/10% indica) strain created by breeders at the infamous Ivita Wellness center in Denver, Colorado. This dank bud is a potent cross between the insanely popular"
Kananga Strain,"This pure – and very rare – African sativa (sativa/indica ratio of 100:0) takes its name from one of the largest cities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Either that or Dr. Kananga, the James Bond villain played by Yaphet Kotto. In any event, Kananga the marijuana strain is an effective treatment for numerous medical conditions, including anxiety, hyperactivity, and inattentiveness. This makes it an ideal choice for patients with mood disorders or ADHD. The high focuses almost exclusively on the mind, a product of Kananga's sativa background. The effects are energized and euphoric, with sharp mental focus and a dose of creativity. Data on the THC and CBD levels in this strain are scarce, but the few available tests suggest neither chemical is abundant: Kananga is roughly 10% THC and less than 1% CBD. The lack of CBD means this strain shouldn't be used to treat seizure disorders or other conditions that require that cannabinoid. Kananga has purple leaves and long, rust-red hairs, along with a frosty layer of trichomes. It smells of flowers and tastes of grapes. This strain is definitely a rarity, at least outside of Africa. It might occasionally appear in the American West, but the easiest way to find it is usually to grow it at home."
Royce’s Raskal OG Strain,"Royce's Raskal OG is a more potent and stronger version of the Raskal OG marijuana strain. It is a hybrid strain that has a THC level of around 17 percent and CBD level is approximately 0.86 percent. It is bred by the Cali Connection and has dense buds that have a deep green color with light green hues. The strain is sticky and soft. It has a strong and relaxing effect on your mind and body. It also makes you drowsy and soon puts you to sleep, which is why it is great for insomnia patients. Its high makes you feel extremely creative, focused and euphoric as well that can help you work on creative jobs. Its aroma and taste are strong and are a good blend of earthy, pine and nutty flavors. Royce’s Raskal OG is excellent for the medical patients of mild and chronic pains. It is a suitable antidote for anxiety and stress as well as it effectively calms down your tensed nerves. You can also use it for getting relief from nausea. Its major side effects include experiencing dry mouth and dry eyes. However, some users tend to suffer from paranoia and anxiety after smoking it as well."
Igzactly Jack Strain,"Igzactly Jack reportedly began as a cut of Platinum Jack Herer, itself a product of the Igzactly 420 medical marijuana dispensary in San Francisco. Named after its creators, Igzactly Jack is a truly rare choice and would be very hard to find outside California's Bay Area. This strain is a sativa-dominant hybrid, but little is widely known about the precise ratio of sativa to indica. The high is mostly cerebral, as the sativa genes suggest, but there is little detailed information on specific effects. But Igzactly Jack is recommended as a treatment for cramps, muscle spasms, and pain. THC and CBD levels are a mystery outside of its home dispensary, but there's no reason to believe this is either a particularly potent or a particularly weak strain. Reports of negative effects are likewise hard to come by, though some patients may experience paranoia, red eyes, or dry mouth. Igzactly Jack has a sweet taste and smell similar to candy, plus notes of pine and spice in the flavor. The nugs are bigger than average, with light green coloring and orange hairs."
Triple Sour Diesel Strain,"The ""triple sour diesel"" is a versatile, strong and a grade A strain. It is technically a sativa dominant strain but has effects that are similar to indica strains. This strain is a hybrid and a rather unique one. It is the result of crossing not two but three different strains namely the NYC diesel, Sour diesel and OG Kush. This combination of both sativa and indica strains is probably the reason why it exhibits qualities of both types. The strain is potent. It has a THC level around 24%. This results in an instant head buzz that, frankly, is not for everyone. Both novice smokers and people who have or are prone to paranoia should refrain from this strain. The strain has two main medicinal uses which include a supplement for people suffering from ADD and also for people with chronic pains. When smoked, besides providing a strong high, this also makes the smokers senses razor sharp. If one takes a whiff of the specimen, it is easily apparent why the words sour and diesel are part of the name. It smells like combinations of pungent chemical and diesel. Same is the case with the taste. It is sour. Appearances aren't different from the majority of strains. It has a dull look and is almost completely light green with the exception of a few orange hairs."
Glowing Goat #5 Strain,"The glowing goat is another, relatively new, hybrid strain. With a THC level of around 20% and a CBD level less than 0.5%, this strain is relatively light in terms of strength. The glowing goat #5 is the result of a combination/cross between the Golden Goat and The White which makes it one of the more unique hybrid strains around. The glowing goat is prescribed to patients that are suffering from a severe lack of appetite or have muscular pain. In other words, it is great for appetite stimulation. This strain is recommended for a day time smoke or for occasions such as, say, a quick happy hour. This means that the strain is not too strong and is not bad for people suffering from insomnia. This particular strain has no discernible aroma to it. The closest the aroma comes to is that of herbs. Taste is where this strain really shines. It has two dominant types of tastes, spicy and fruity at the same time. Most smokers find mango as the base taste for it with just a hint of Sriracha (a type of hot sauce). In terms of appearances, it is covered with small patches of light and dark green with a few orange hairs."
Walter 2014 Strain,"Walter 2014 is an extremely rare hybrid strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy. The sativa/indica ratio is unknown for this strain, although it is widely agreed that it is likely a sativa dominant hybrid strain due to its effects. This dank bud boasts a THC level ranging from 22-24% on average and a myriad of primarily sativa effects. Users describe the Walter 2014 high as one that is dominated by an instantaneous euphoric cerebral head high with significant mind relief that leaves you energized, focused, and motivated with artistic tendencies. This intense energy rush is accompanied by a mellow body buzz that anchors you, keeping you from becoming anxious and leaving you relaxed and at ease. Due to these potent effects, Walter 2014 is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as inflammation, tension headaches and migraines, and chronic pain due to illness or injury. This strain has big fluffy neon green popcorn shaped nugs that are dense with dark olive green undertones, fiery orange hairs, and a thin layer of almost translucent trichomes and resin. Walter 2014 has a taste of bittersweet spicy earth that sweetens upon exhale and a smell of sweet spicy earth."
Enhanced Dutch Crunch Strain,"The strain is produced by crossing two different hard-hitting strains from Netherlands, Dutch Treat and Jack Herer. With THC content that can fall anywhere between 20 and 24%, it is potent enough to knock out individuals who are new to smoking cannabis. But one thing is for certain: the buds are a treat to look at. The nuggets are light green in color and have an exceptional amount of resin and crystal. Additionally, you will notice tan hairs seeping through the surface of the buds which are dense but are not as large as you would expect them to be. Enhanced Dutch Crunch smells sweet and piney, whereas its taste is more distinct as it delivers a blend of sweet, spicy and sugary flavors that linger in the mouth for longer. Enhanced Dutch Crunch not only hits hard but it lasts longer than most indica dominant strains. There is more to it than meets the eye. After a hit or two, you will experience euphoria and will feel extremely happy. The high does not cloud your senses but will in fact offer a clear-headed experience. The effects are calming which is just what you will need after a tiring day at work. But that is not all, as the strain has several medical applications and is recommended for patients for the treatment of irregular bowel movements, muscle spasms, diarrhea and inflammation."
Fruit Punch Kush Strain,"This indica-dominant medical marijuana strain has gained reputation for providing the users with the fruity punch in its taste. As the name of the strain suggests, the smell is also fruity, pungent and syrupy in nature. The ancestry of this strain is unknown. The THC levels are found to be up to 20.4%. The nugs of this strain are tightly packed and will be covered with small green colored hairs. There are also pistils that are light orange colored. When we grind this strain, the hashy notes will be released. The buzz that is produced by this strain will be calming and relaxing. This will be good for the patients who are undertaking chemotherapy for getting relieved from pain. Other symptoms that could be relieved by this strain are depression and nausea. In addition, this strain can be helpful in treating diabetes."
Grape Grand Daddy Purple Strain,"This Indica hybrid is a trippy head buzzer; a vibrant strain with a marble-maze patterns of orange, purple, green, amber and yellow. Grape Grand Daddy is grade A psychoactive nugget with stunning potency, effectively tying you to the couch. With dreamy buzz and droopy eyes, you fly high above the skies, with all the pain and stress leaving your body right after the first hit. This sweet grapefruit candy has an intoxicating and fruity smell which leaves you blowing out the stress in smooth skunky exhales and cherishing the leftovers of grapefruit on your taste buds. Ideal for novice growers, it can be grown indoor in soil, air or water with a flowering cycle of 8-9 weeks. Great for doing away with social strain, eating disorders and sleep problems, its heavy and warm indica buzz provides you a cooler version of grape wine, triggering appetite or letting you fade away into blissful sleep. It is a fast vaporizer and diffuses easily in the air; a good package for workplace. The trickledown effect of this purple candy sweetly takes you to the world of dreams making it a perfect shot for the nights."
Afghan #1 Strain,"A couchlock strain in the truest sense of the word, Afghan #1 is one of the first pure Indica strains, getting its name from its geographic region. This pure classic strain is best known for its dense and soft buds, which have been stored by many strain gene pools and marijuana stockists worldwide. Its strong bushy plant can be grown indoor or outdoor with 40-45 days fruition time; novice growers need to beware of its heavily aromatic stem though. Its sweet earthy aroma is the key to unlock the gardens of euphoria and sedation. This massively relaxing nugget for stress, pain, insomnia, anxiety and migraines takes you on a journey of sleep, creativity, and happiness. Unlike other indica strains, this couchlock strain is a godsend for those who cannot sleep at night. Its pungent smell, sweet taste and strong potency in parallel to all other indica strains attract breeders from all over the world. Serious insomniacs need just a little dose 20-30 minutes before bedtime. The pungent smell knocks you out and couched for long. It is a gold-standard strain for pure indica lovers- the softest quilt for sound sleep."
OG Dutch Treat #5 Strain,"There are three strains of cannabis used to create OG Dutch Treat #5. They include Haze, Skunk #1, and Northern Lights. This is believed to be one of the fastest acting calming and relaxing forms of marijuana offered. This is a Sativa strain offering THC up to 18%. The buds of OG Dutch Treat #5 are dense and sticky. They smell very good, like a mixture of fresh fruits. There is also a hint of pine and eucalyptus. It is important not to harvest it too soon s that can reduce the yield by half. The high produced by OG Dutch Treat #5 comes on very quickly. It delivers an uplifting, euphoric experience. This cannabis is often used to reduce stress or anxiety. It can be used to treat mild to moderate depression."
NoHo Private Reserve OG Strain,"This remarkable strain is 100 percent pure Indica. With that, it belongs to the house reserve of North Hollywood Organics. It has plum-sized buds with sticky leaves. As a result, when you try to pluck its nugs, they tend to tear away rather than break out. This brown tinted strain has an exceptional THC value of 25% and CBD level 10%, which makes it practicable mostly for a pro smoker. NoHo Private Reserve OG is an excellent source of getting relief from prevailing symptoms such as anxiety, inflammation, migraines, nausea, pain, sleeplessness and associated stress. It has a minty aroma and possesses a buzz that is euphoric, cerebral and happy. In terms of flavor, it carries a sour taste. NoHo Private Reserve OG is most commonly recommended for people who are undergoing cancer therapy. This strain reduces nausea, migraines and insomnia in such patients. It even helps to overcome pain related with arthritis in patients that have HIV or AIDS. If you are experiencing any of those symptoms, NoHo Private Reserve OG overcomes them. For maximized effectiveness, you should get your hands on this strain during night. Taking up this particular strain via pipe is the most recommended way to do so."
Platinum Green Crack Strain,"THC levels can exceed 20% in Platinum Green Crack, making this a very potent medical choice for patients looking to treat anxiety, inflammation, physical pain, and glaucoma related ocular conditions. The sativa genes are very dominant in this strain, which has a sativa/indica ratio of 80:20. That genetic background makes for intense cerebral effects with mental clarity and a vibrant boost of energy. But because CBD levels are very low, much lower than 1%, Platinum Green Crack shouldn't be used as the only medication for the treatment of seizures or other health conditions that respond to that chemical. It's not clear exactly which parents produced this hybrid, but presumably the original Green Crack was one of them. Platinum Green Crack has a sweet smell of apples and a similar flavor, while the green nugs are leafy with brown hairs. Patients can expect the usual marijuana side effects, including cottonmouth and dry eyes, though detailed reports on the subject are scarce. This strain is available at medical marijuana dispensaries in California, Colorado, and New Mexico, though it may sometimes also be found on the black market."
Wreck of Angels Strain,"A sativa-dominant strain, Wreck of Angels is a delicious and potent hybrid that can give you a strong high in just a toke or two, cheering you up as soon as it hits. The Wreck of Angels plant has beautiful nuggets that have frenzied branches and trichome stalks. The stalks are densely spaced, clear and very strong. This strain has a sweet candy-sugar scent with a pleasant hint of pine and spice in it. The spicy and sweet blend of flavors is quite appealing to the senses and will give you a delightful and well-deserved break from your busy schedule. The floral fragranced strain is a favorite among patients who need help with issues like depression, alcohol abuse, multiple sclerosis and Tourette Syndrome. The strain can pull you out of the dumps and take you high in just a few smokes. However, novice smokers must smoke carefully as it can cause anxiety in those who are trying marijuana strains for the first time. Best to lighten up your mood, this strain can help you relax and unwind after a long and tiring day."
Van Nuys OG Strain,"Van Nuys OG is a 100% pure indica hybrid strain that is said to have been created by breeders at the infamous Heavenly Herbal Collective in Van Nuys, California, the original creators of the hugely popular Blue Dream strain. Although the exact parentage of Van Nuys OG is kept a secret by its breeders, it is said to be an OG Kush phenotype bred specifically to provide powerful indica effects. This dank bud boasts a THC level ranging from 15-23% on average and a myriad of indica effects. Users describe the Van Nuys OG high as one that has a slowly creeping onset of about 20-30 minutes. Once the high hits, the users feel immensely calm and relaxed with slightly psychoactive tendencies. You may feel spacey and a little distracted, but not overwhelmingly so. This slowly fades into a warming body stone that leaves you completely couch-locked and eventually eases you into a deep sleep. Due to these potent effects, this train is ideal for treating chronic pain, insomnia, and chronic stress. Van Nuys OG has a typical OG Kush aroma and taste of peppery lemon hash. These buds have oversized fluffy neon green popcorn-shaped nugs with a spattering of amber hairs and bronze undertones with fine trichomes and resin."
Kaia Kush Strain,"Kaia Kush is a hybrid cannabis strain that leans more towards the Sativa side. It has an Indica/ Sativa ratio of 40/60 percent.

Its calming high makes you feel creative, euphoric, energized and happy. It has a floral and spicy aroma and its strong taste is a blend of earthy and spicy flavors. Kaia Kush is good for treating anxiety and provides relief from a wide range of chronic pains."
Palliative OG Strain,"If this strain's name brings to mind images of gentle medical care, it's no accident. Palliative OG is just what it says it is: a great medical palliative. It can be used to treat mood disorders, depression, glaucoma and ocular pressure, nausea, and chronic pain, among other problems. This strain is essentially just a house version of OG Kush, a legendary sativa-dominant hybrid that has parented a long list of modern strains. It's unclear how much of Palliative OG is sativa and how much indica, so it's hard to say much about the effects, but the sativa dominance presumably means the high is predominantly cerebral. But physical aspects are also present, making this an effective stress reliever. Palliative OG has a reddish-green appearance and a glossy layer of resinous crystals. THC and CBD levels are unclear, though THC has topped 19% in at least one test. The lack of data about CBD content suggests this strain shouldn't be used as the only source of treatment for seizures or other conditions that respond to CBD. Palliative OG is the special creation of the Palliative Health Center in San Jose, Cal., and they're apparently the only legal source of the stuff."
Colorado Crippler Strain,"Colorado Crippled is a 50/50 hybrid of Blue Cheese and Grape Hash Plant. Like any good plate of cheese, it is a combination of muskiness, with the sweetness of vine fruit. Usually, it is covered in trichrome and it is highly recommended to use a grinder to separate the forest green and royal purple nugs.

The pain relief provided by this strain is closer to that of the indica end of the range. The Colorado Crippled is mostly used by people suffering from withdrawal symptoms. It relaxes the body and is also assumed to restore nerve function. The Colorado Crippler provides relief from muscle spasms, insomnia, moderate pains and nerve issues. It possesses a very spicy smell and also contains hints of pine. It is also said to help with inflammation and is popular because of its musky and fruity aromas."
Greenleaf Platinum Cookies Strain,"Greenleaf Platinum Cookies, also known as ""Greenleaf Platinum Girl Scout Cookies,"" is a super dank indica dominant hybrid (85% indica/15% sativa) strain created by breeders at the infamous Greenleaf Farms. This potent bud is a cross between the insanely popular"
Platinum Limón Strain,"This indica-dominant hybrid strain may be potent, but it definitely isn't well known. It can be found in a handful of pot shops in Colorado, and possibly in a few California dispensaries, but otherwise it's very scarce, especially on the black market. There is little available information on cannabinoid levels in Platinum Limón, including THC and CBD, but this strain is known more for its high than for its other medical benefits. THC appears to be high and CBD low, in other words. That means it generally shouldn't be used alone to treat seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD. But this strain is good for alleviating mood disorders, nerve pain, chronic pain, and tumors. The Platinum Limón high lasts a long time and has a wide range of physical and mental qualities: There's a calming body buzz, a clear-headed cerebral effect, energy, euphoria, and happiness. This strain has a smooth herbal flavor with hints of lemon and an earthy citrus smell. Side effects aren't widely reported, but that's because this strain is rare; it likely produces dry mouth and red eyes."
Oceanside OG Strain,"Oceanside OG is a pure indica strain with relatively low potency. It's not especially popular, on or off the legal market, but it can be fairly effective as a medication. It can be used to treat inflammation, migraines, pain, and insomnia. Oceanside delivers a body-centered physical buzz, with calming couch-lock effects. The high is sleepy and spacey. THC and CBD levels are anyone's guess, but it isn't known as a very powerful strain. Adverse effects are also unclear, though dry mouth is always likely when smoking marijuana, as are bloodshot eyes. Oceanside smells and tastes of flowers, though there is little more information about flavor, aroma, or appearance. That's because this is definitely not a common choice pretty much anywhere. Presumably it's most popular in California and possibly elsewhere in the American West. But it's hard to find on the legal market, and it's a rare occurrence when it comes around on the black market. It's neither a popular choice for medicine nor a favorite of recreational users. The genetic history of this plant is largely a mystery, though it obviously descends from other pure indicas."
Hong Kong Diesel Strain,"Hong Kong Diesel, also known as simply ""Hong Kong"" to some users, is an extremely potent even hybrid (40% indica/60% sativa) strain created by breeders at the Walking Raven farms, Denver's first official medical marijuana dispensary applicant back in 2009. This strain is a cross between the hugely popular"
Jack Black Strain,"Jack Black is also popularly referred to as Black Jack. The strain is a cross between Jack Herer and Black Domina, it is a hybrid strain with a sensational 22% THC content. The buds are huge and hard, they are dense and tight all the while being fluffy and sticky at the same time. Upon closer inspection, you will come to realize the buds look no different than grape-like calyxes. That being said, it is one of the most popular of all strains amongst the medical marijuana patient community. The taste and aroma is a perfect mixture of fruity flavors which will keep you coming back for more. Moreover, the strain does provide thick smoke, which can be overpowering at times and is quite similar to sour wine at times. Once you have had a hit or two, you will feel a burst of energy almost instantaneously. The high can be extremely strong but you will remain focused. What is even more interesting is the fact that Jack Black is equally effective at relieving symptoms of pains and aches due to its numbing effects. On the other hand, the strain is also used to treat several medical conditions like anxiety, stress and even depression."
McFly Strain,"McFly is a cross between Sour Queen Beans and C99. It is a hybrid strain with an amazing 22% THC content. The strain is named after Marty McFly from Back to the Future and is incredibly potent. The buds are dense, but not as large as any other strain you may have medicated with before. As for the smell, it is spicy and extremely skunky. However, it is not as skunky as Spice Girls or Chinese Five Spice Powder but it is spicy nevertheless. The taste is smooth and delicious with danky undertones and peppermint or spearmint in the background. The strain offers a heady high that will have you soaring above the clouds in no time (not to be taken literally). You will feel relaxed and incredibly calm but it can knock you out if you are not careful. It takes some time for the high to kick in which is why you need to take it easy. McFly is a creeper and it will overwhelm you when you least expect it. That being said, the strain is incredibly useful if you are looking for something in order to relieve symptoms of depression. Furthermore, it is just as effective for treating medical conditions like anxiety and chronic pains and aches at the same time."
Mexican Sunrise Strain,"Mexican Sunrise is an indica dominant hybrid with an 80:20 indica sativa ratio. The strain is a cross between OG Kush, Blue Dream, Permafrost and Girl Scout Cookies, which also explains why it is a heavy hitter. Mexican Sunrise looks no different than a Dutch treat and there is no doubt about it. It smells exquisite with honey, pine and woody undertones. As for the taste it is just about the same as the smell very smooth and sweet which is something to look forward to. It is the perfect strain to medicate with and is a mouth watering treat for cannabis users. The high lasts longer and will leave you in a state of calm in no time. What is really interesting about the strain is that even though it numbs your body, it does not completely knock you out. You retain the ability to think clearly and remain active throughout the day. This is why it is often recommended for daytime use as it allows patients to stay focused regardless of the task at hand. Apart from a relaxing high, the strain is equally effective at relieving symptoms of chronic pains and aches along with anxiety."

Bubblicious Cookies Strain,"Bubblicious Cookies is an indica dominant hybrid strain with a 65:35 indica/sativa ratio and has more to offer than a good high. The strain is produced by crossing Querkle and Pandora's Box. The end result is luscious buds that are good enough to eat, well maybe not. The buds are green but quite colorful at the same time. Additionally, most of the buds have an exceptional coverage of orange hairs as well. As for the smell, it offers an exquisite blend of kush, earthy and bubblegum aroma which will keep you coming back for more. The taste is just about the same and tends to leave a pleasant aftertaste that will linger in your mouth for quite some time. The strain starts off with a sensational body buzz. This high then transforms into a cerebral buzz that will leave you calm and relaxed. You will feel relieved and will be euphoric at the same time. Additionally, you will feel really talkative as well. The strain delivers psychoactive effects and can at times put you to sleep if consumed in larger doses.

Its genes lean heavily toward the sativa side, producing a sativa/indica ratio of 75:25. THC levels can be remarkably high, with test results topping 25%. That puts this strain on the top shelf in terms of potency. But CBD levels are another story, with available tests showing numbers below 1%, much too low to recommend Super Sour D3 as a good treatment for epilepsy or other conditions that respond to CBD. The powerful high is mostly cerebral, with intense happiness and a deeply calming mental effect. It's an ideal choice for social occasions and busy days – but only for smokers who can tolerate its potency. Newcomers and part-timers would do best to avoid this strain. But for many patients Super Sour D3 is an effective treatment for anxiety, pain, inflammation, and stress. It has a fruity smell and flavor with hints of pine needles. Cottonmouth is the most widely reported side effect, followed by red eyes, headaches, and paranoia.

Many users like it because it helps them to be in a better mood and overall better frame of mind. Too much stress can make it hard for a person to sleep well. With the use of Yogi Diesel, the relaxed feeling is one that often helps people to sleep much better. Yet you won't wake up groggy like you can with various medications that treat insomnia."

The strain was awarded the High Times Cannabis Cup in 2012 and has become a favorite of the cannabis community. The strain produces dense buds that are dark green in color. The nuggets usually have elongated calyxes with a platinum coating coverage of resin. The nuggets have a unique aroma which is spicy and earthy at the same time. As for the taste, it is piney, skunky with a hint of lemon. The strain primarily offers a body buzz than a cerebral one. It may even exhibit symptoms of couch-lock. This is one of the reasons why it is recommended for nighttime use. But then again, it is quite calming and soothing. After smoking the strain, you will prefer a little peace and quiet. You may even get the munchies which is why it would be wise to keep some snacks around while you are medicating with the strain. That being said, considering its effects it is quite effective at treating medical conditions like mood disorders, depression, anxiety, chronic pains and even insomnia."

William's Wonder is an indica-dominant hybrid with THC levels reaching 19%, while Tang Tang is a sativa-dominant hybrid with unknown THC content. Like its sativa parent, Highwayman is rare, even in places where marijuana is legal for medical or recreational use. Apparently an homage to Willie Nelson and the rest of the famed Highwaymen, this strain is best used to treat chronic pain, including migraines and arthritis, along with anxiety and depression. It has a bright green, frosted appearance, with streaks of gold. The nugs appear light but are in fact quite dense. Highwayman smells distinctly of chocolate and coffee. This strain is probably most popular on the West Coast, though its geographic origins are unknown. It's worth a try if you can find it, if only to pay respect to country music's greatest stoners. Prepare to feel stress and pain melt away in seconds."
Cosmic Brain Strain,"Cosmic Brain is a hard hitting indica dominant hybrid with a 70:30 indica/ sativa ratio. It is a cross between Space Queen and Oregon Afghani, not only is it extremely potent but it is armed with an equally powerful narcotic effect. The strain tastes earthy with hints of Kush and coffee to go along with it. The same can also be the said about its smell as it is more or less the same along with cherry undertones. As for the high, it packs quite a punch. Not only does the strain offer a cerebral high but it calms the body at the same time. It is an excellent way to get some relief from a hectic day, regardless of how stressed you maybe. However, you have to keep in mind that it is recommended for night time use. On the other hand, it does have does have medical uses for patients suffering from stress, sleeplessness and anxiety. But then again, if you are a first time user, it would be wise to stay clear of the strain as it will do more harm than good."
Cherry Slyder Strain,"Cherry Slyder is an Indica dominant hybrid with an earthy, cherry flavour. It constitutes of cherry bark, pine and diesel aromas and is well known for having a very strong fruity flavour to make taste buds tingle. Its genetic composition is a cross between Northern Lights and Afghani genetics, and it has a CBD level of 0.13 per cent and a more promising THC level of 19 per cent. Also, its CBN level is at 0.52 percent. Cherry Slyder is most often used by patients who are looking for something that can help in overcoming symptoms of nausea, pain, insomnia and anxiety. It provides an overall relaxation in the body by bringing your body muscles at ease, lessening the muscle pain, and relishing a freshly strong appetite. This strain helps a patient in keeping them almost entirely calm, without hampering their focus, but still remaining psychoactive. It is a big plus for this particular medical marijuana strain as you can keep your head held high and stay in control of your conscience in terms of the mind and the body."
Heavenly Haze Strain,"Heavenly Haze is an indica dominant strain (40:60 sativa/ indica ratio) and is a cross between Haze, Afghani, Northern Lights #5 and Hawaiian. The buds are huge and are packed with resins, thus making it quite appealing for most patients. It tends to offer a haze flavor along with a hint of Afghani. The diverse qualities offered by the strain should do more than appease you. There is no denying that the aroma is slightly metallic, but the taste on the inhale is icy-cold and offers something different from what you would normally expect. After smoking the strain, you will come to appreciate the mellow, relaxing effects with the buzzing energy that comes along with it. But that is not all, as you will also notice an increase in focus and concentration while being clear-headed at the same time. That being said, it is immensely popular among patients suffering from various medical conditions. The strain is highly effective at relieving symptoms of pain, depression, anxiety and irritability. On the other hand, you will not have to worry about any drawbacks, as it has none. But patients are advised to use it as an evening smoke."
Yampa Valley Couch-Lock Strain,Yampa Valley Couch-Lock is a 100% pure indica strain that is a potent cross between the insanely popular
isLAnd Strain,"Island is also better known as Sweet Island Skunk and ISS, it is a sativa dominant strain with a 80:20 sativa/indica ratio and can have as much as 19% THC level. However, you have to keep in mind it is not to be confused with Sweet Skunk. It looks quite gorgeous and has dense and long spear shaped flowers that glisten with traces of resin. Additionally, the patchwork is combination of light and dark green along with hints of orange, red, blue and purple. It smells like a grapefruit, which is absolutely mouth watering. The high is quite different from what any other strain you are already used to. It starts behind the eyes and gradually makes its way down to the rest of your body. After fifteen to twenty minutes you may feel hungry, which is shortly followed by analgesic effects. If you are looking for a daytime smoke, you should not look any further. You will still feel energetic and focused. You will come to realize mundane tasks will become much more enjoyable for you. As for the benefits, they are plenty. There is no doubt it is an incredible sexual stimulant. You will note that it not only increases stamina but enhances sensation quite dramatically."
After Life OG Strain,"This soothing 70/30 indica dominant strain inherits its essence from female Ghostrider OG and and the frosty male Starfighter F2. After Life OG is an Exotic Genetix breed that takes the buzz of Ghostrider OG to the next level and brings about relief, euphoria and pure unadulterated joy. With 53 days of indoor flowering time, the plant has no feminized seeds. It can also be grown outdoors. The dankness and frost of Starfighter covers the second layer of Ghostrider's hoopla, giving you the double dose of relief from stress and pain and riding you to a sound sleep. The dense and pungent aroma will fuel you up with funk. Its sweet flavors of honey and watermelon grow a sugar paradise around you, sprinkling your soul with the serenity of midnight dew drops. The buzz drives its strength from Ghostrider OG. Inhale once and you will feel the energy gathering around you. It is the perfect solution to stave off stress, pain, anxiety and insomnia; a ship to the planet of calm."
Ms. Universe Strain,"Ms. Universe, an offspring of Dess*tar and Space Queen, is known for its sativa-dominant high and complementary body buzz. The effects are psychoactive and uplifting, spurring creativity, delivering a dose of euphoria, and creating a tingly, giggly sensation. Use Ms. Universe as treatment for anxiety, depression, mood disorders, fatigue, lack of appetite, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. THC levels vary, but available tests suggest they're moderately high, at least 14% in some cases. CBD levels, meanwhile, are much lower, less than 1%, which means Ms. Universe may not be a great choice for conditions that require CBD, including childhood seizure disorders. The bud is green with brown hairs and a layer of crystals. Depending on its phenotype, this strain can smell like candy, caramel, cherry, pineapple, or vanilla. The taste is similar. Negative effects are something of a mystery, as there are few public reports, but dry mouth and dry eyes are typical of most strains. Ms. Universe can be found on the medical markets in Oregon and Montana, but it's far from common in other parts of the United States."
Cherry Assassin Strain,"This indica strain of unknown origin gets its name from its distinct cherry flavor and sweet diesel smell. It's an uncommon choice for medical patients, hard to find almost everywhere. Little is known about it, including the exact ratio of sativa to indica. It's probably a cross of Cherry AK47 and Captain Krypt OG, but nobody seems to know for sure. There is no reliable data on THC contents in this strain, let alone the CBD contents, so it's hard to say with any certainty how Cherry Assassin works on patients. But the high is body-oriented, with a euphoric sleepiness. There are also more limited cerebral effects, including a mood boost. This strain is probably best used to treat pain, insomnia, and anxiety. It's not recommended as a treatment for conditions that respond to CBD, and detailed medical information is scarce. Side effects likely include dry mouth and dry eyes. The bud of Cherry Assassin has a dark green appearance, flecked with gold and coated in trichomes. This strain is a definite specialty, and it may be difficult to find it outside legal markets in the American West."
God's Green Gift Strain,"God's Green Gift, aka simply as ""God's Gift,"" is an indica-dominant hybrid (10:90 sativa/indica ratio) with THC levels that can top 22%. That makes this one of the strongest choices available for medical relief. CBD levels are negligible, so this isn't a good choice for patients suffering from epilepsy or other conditions that respond to CBD marijuana. The indica-fueled body high is intensely lazy, with a shot of euphoria and a strong mood boost. Sleepiness is also common, making this a great product for treating insomnia. Other medical uses include stress and anxiety, chronic pain, and depression. Anyone looking for deep relaxation should give this effective strain a try. Side effects are possible, as always, especially dry mouth and bloodshot eyes. Other adverse effects are more limited, including dizziness and paranoia. God's Green Gift has a strong pungent odor and a sweet earthy flavor. The dense buds have a vibrant purple hue with a dense layer of trichomes. This relatively recent strain was born in California in 2005. It's most common on the West Coast and in Michigan, though it can be found in other places."
Dragon Lady Strain,"Dragon Lady is a popular strain among those who have tried it, but there aren't all that many of them. It's a combo of Blue Dragon and Flo, both sativa dominant hybrids. Despite the name, THC levels are lower than in most other legal-market strains, but the high is relatively long-lasting, and it promotes creativity. Exact THC numbers are unknown, though Flo reaches top THC levels of just 14-18%. Dragon Lady has a strong plant aroma, with notes of musk and spice. It tastes earthy, sweet, and fresh. The high is relaxing, fueled by the plant's sativa genes, but also slightly cerebral. Expect a mood boost and a mild feeling of euphoria. Dragon Lady is best used for depression, bipolar disorder, and chronic pain. Its calming effects can also be helpful with problems falling asleep. The sativa genes, meanwhile, provide a pleasant cerebral effect that clears the mind. Possible adverse effects include dry mouth and dry eyes, while other problems are more rare. Dragon Lady can be found in California, though even there few dispensaries stock it."
Tragic Strain,"Tragic is an indica dominant hybrid strain. It is a cross between Magic and Trainwreck. The strain originates from Humbolt County which is located in California and is primarily used for its medicinal properties. What is really interesting about the medical cannabis is that it smells fruity and sweet. The taste however is nowhere near how the strain actually smells. It in fact tastes like pine with woody undertones. The high from smoking Tragic is unlike any other medicinal strain you may have come across. It will generate a body buzz that will lead to a state of euphoria where you will feel relaxed and happy regardless of how horrible your day already may have been. Moreover, you can expect long lasting effects from the strain, which is unusual since it is an indica dominant strain. That being said, the strain is incredibly useful due to its medicinal properties. It can aid in treating several medical conditions including chronic pains and aches, depression, anxiety and even insomnia. However, you have to keep in mind that the strain is not recommended for first time users and needs to be smoked in controlled doses for maximum effectiveness."
OG Goo Strain,"There isn't much in the way of OG genetics in OG Goo, and for that matter it has no apparent ties to Afgooey, a popular indica-dominant hybrid. Instead, OG Obama is the offspring of Hindu Kush and Blueberry. It's an indica-dominant strain (20:80 sativa/indica ratio). The high, mostly physical, is deeply sedating and relaxing, mixed with more mild cerebral effects. There isn't much available data on THC or CBD contents, but presumably the THC rate is probably notably higher than the CBD level. As a result, OG Goo works very well in treating sleeplessness, chronic pain, and muscle spasms. It's also an effective treatment for anxiety and lack of appetite. Expect a sweet, fruity blueberry taste and aroma, with sour, earthy notes and hints of lemon or pineapple. The bud can have either a bright green or darker green appearance. Side effect information is limited, but dry mouth or bloodshot eyes are likely common. OG Goo is relatively easy to find on the West Coast, where it's popular in California and Oregon, along with the legal medical market in Arizona."
White Indica Strain,"The indica side of this hybrid definitely wins out, delivering a calm, sleepy high ideal for late nights and rainy days indoors. The ratio of sativa to indica is roughly 30:70, though it can reach as low as 10:90. The THC content of White Indica is quite high, about 20% at most, while CBD content is very low, about 0.3%. The exact origins of this powerful strain are not widely known, though it probably descends from original landrace plants found in Afghanistan and Pakistan. White Indica has a strong, pungent earthy flavor with hints of pine. The aroma is similar, while the bud has a white frosted appearance due to a thick layer of resinous trichomes. The indica genes provide a potent, euphoric high with deep body relaxation and a powerful case of the munchies. This strain can be useful in treating anxiety, depression, and insomnia, together with nausea and chronic pain. Finding this unique strain can be something of a challenge in the United States, though it can be purchased in dispensaries in Arizona, and possibly elsewhere in the American West."
Ultra Skunk Strain,"Big Bud was crossed with F2 generation Skunk to create Ultra Skunk, a sativa-dominant hybrid out of Holland. Bred by the famed Dutch Passion seed bank, this strain has a sativa/indica ratio of 60:40 and is highly regarded by patients who have tried it. THC levels are modest, measuring roughly 11% in available tests. CBD numbers are harder to find, but that alone suggests Ultra Skunk isn't a good choice for treating seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to CBD. But it can be very effective as treatment for anxiety, depression, nausea, and bodily pains. The high is decidedly cerebral, reflecting the sativa genes, and delivers a combination of creativity, euphoria, and psychoactive effects. Not surprisingly, Ultra Skunk has a Skunky aroma and flavor, with sweet notes of lemons, limes, and other varieties of fruit. The bud is lime green with hairs of bright orange. There are few public reports of side effects, but probably include cottonmouth, red eyes, and anxiety. Try this medical selection if you can find it, but don't look too hard, as it's a decided rarity outside of Amsterdam."
LA Park Strain,"LA Park is an indica dominant hybrid (70% indica/30% sativa) strain with unknown parentage due to breeder secrecy, although it is thought to be related to LA Confidential. This bud is infamous for its insanely high CBD level of 5-10% on average with a low THC level that tops out at 2%. The LA Park high is incredibly relaxing in nature, with a slowly building onset of a heavy duty deep body buzz and full body stone. This body high is incredibly relaxing and drops you into a long-lasting ocean of physical and mental relief and purity. A clear-headed effect is paired with this body stone, leaving you awake while your body melts into utter ease. These effects coupled with its powerful CBD level make this bud perfect for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress or anxiety, extreme muscular pain, depression, and inflammation. LA Park buds have small and incredibly dense grape-shaped nugs with hints of peach and dark orange coloration and long thin transparent hairs. Each nug is completely coated in thick oversized chunky clear trichomes that almost look bubbly. It has an aroma of skunky diesel with a pungent earthy effect and a flavor of sweet spicy skunk with a hint of fuel."
White Siberian Strain,"The CBD content in this White Widow offspring is high, though the exact quantities are unclear. The THC content is also relatively high for a strain with a strong dose of CBD, probably about 15%. With a sativa/indica ratio of 25:75, this hybrid delivers a subdued effect felt mostly in the body. Among its other uses, White Siberian is a strong appetite booster, so patients with wasting disorders may find it particularly useful. The high is mostly relaxed, with a dose of happiness. Users may find themselves gabbing more than usual while high on this strain. The taste and smell are earthy and woody, with a subtle flowery aroma. White Siberian is a cross between the notorious AK-47 and White Widow, though it doesn't provide the potency of either of those strains. White Siberian is best for use with depression and chronic pain, as well as ADHD and GI problems. Anxiety and paranoia are the most likely side effects. This strain is a regional rarity found mostly in Arizona, so try it if you can find it."
Alien Technology Strain,"This indica cannabis strain hails from Afghanistan and is a pure landrace marijuana strain. The beautiful plant of Alien Technology has fluffy light green buds tinted with dark emerald patches and covered with orange and brown pistils. The spicy beef jerky aroma of this strain compliments its spicy Afghan flavor. The strain has a smooth, rich and delicious nag champa taste blended with vanilla sweetness and leaves a turpentine aftertaste. The strain sinks in immediately and the buzz lasts for up to 6 hours. A few tokes of this heavenly strain have a calming effect on sore muscles and joints and offer a pleasant relief from physical and mental stress. An ideal getaway from a hectic and monotonous schedule, this strain ensures that you get the pleasant cerebral high you deserve. It detaches you from the harsh realities of life for a few hours and drowns you in feelings of pure indulgence and euphoria. Not only will it uplift your mood, it will also fire up your senses and enlighten you from within. A toke or two of this miraculous strain will do wonders to transform your mental state into that of pure satisfaction and pleasure."
LA Affie Strain,"The LA Affie Strain, also known as “Affi,” has a sweet but strong flavor that reacts and makes you feel the effects of the strain quickly. The LA Affie Strain is known to be very effective for making you feel better when you have headaches. It is also especially effective for treating anxiety and nausea. The LA Affie Strain is also good for getting rid of insomnia as it presses down on the most stressed parts of the human brain and relaxes it. This allows the person to sleep without facing any kind of disturbance prior to sleeping or during sleep. The LA Affie Strain is also particularly helpful in alleviating many kinds of pain from the different parts of the human body. It also gives the person an energetic kick depending on the type of person inhaling the strain. The Strain is known popularly as a psychedelic. It is a 100% indicia strain, which can be easily grown in a matter of 8 to 9 weeks since that is the time it requires to flower itself. The LA Affie Strain comes with a powerful but a very beautiful aroma that many people tend to feel drawn to. If you want to relax, the LA Affie Strain is the one for you indeed."
Ole 47 Strain,"A unique strain is Ole 47 and it has been around since the 1970s. It was one of the first known breeding experiments with Sativa and Indica strains. It is 80:20 Sativa/Indica and the THC level is about 15%. While that is on the low side compared to many of the cannabis strains offered today, not everyone is looking for a powerful high. The smell of Ole 47 is Earthy and fruity. The taste is very smooth and fruity and offers a warm feeling in the throat as it is smoked. The high takes place quickly and can last for a couple of hours. The Ole 47 plants offer very large leaves that create a decent amount of crystals for harvest. These plants grow very tall. The use of this marijuana has been often to help a person focus and to be more creative as well as alert. It can also be used to reduced inflammation and mild pain. Some individuals use it to increase appetite."
PsychOG Strain,"PsychOG certainly sounds like a potent medical choice. But while THC levels allegedly top 23% in some tests, it's not clear how reliable those numbers are. Still, this hybrid mix of Fire OG and Headband delivers heavy indica body effects thanks to its sativa/indica ratio of roughly 30:70. The high includes a pleasing physical buzz, a strong helping of euphoria, and deep-body relaxation. It's a great way to deal with low mood, migraines and other headaches, and insomnia. PsychOG isn't recommended as exclusive treatment for seizure disorders, however, since it's not known for its CBD content; the same goes for other conditions that respond to that cannabinoid. Expect a pungent, earthy aroma and a somewhat similar flavor. The buds contain a healthy layer of trichome crystals. Reports of negative side effects are hard to come by, but they probably include dry mouth and red eyes, as those are common to most strains. PsychOG is certainly a popular selection among the patients who have tried it, but it's far from widespread. The safest bet is California or elsewhere on the West Coast, though it's probably scarce even there."
Rugburn OG Strain,"Rugburn OG, also known simply as ""The Rugburn"" to some users, is an insanely potent indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain that was created by breeders at the famous Rare Dankness Seeds. This bud is a cross between the hugely popular"
Tickle Kush Strain,Tickle Kush is a recently developed indica dominant hybrid strain created through a cross of the infamous
Elvis OG Strain,"This 'princely' strain originates from the powerful 'AK-47' breed when it is mixed with 'Skunk#1'. The originating two, in this case, are the powerhouses of the world of medicinal cannabis. The sativa dominance existing in this strain accounts for 70 to 90%, with a sativa – indica ratio of 75:25. The THC level has been recorded as 16% on average. This strain has a hard-hitting reaction once it enters the body, therefore it is advised that only people with really high tolerance should make use of this strain. Elvis OG has a simultaneous approach in order to counter the health issues in patients. It mellows out a patient so that their anxiety dies down, while providing a strong dose of energy which elevates creativity in the patient's brain. It is also capable of fighting chronic pain and getting rid of severe migraines. However, it may have an adverse reaction in patients with low tolerance. These side effects are felt as hallucinations and dizziness, making it unsuitable for some. The earthy taste of 'Skunk#1' combines with the sweetness of 'AK-47' leaving a complex taste on the tongue and a sweet aroma."
Platinum Trainwreck Strain,"The cerebral high from this sativa-heavy hybrid (sativa/indica ration unknown) is energized and euphoric, with sharp mental focus and clear thinking. Nobody seems to know how Platinum Trainwreck – aka Platinum Wreck – came to be, but it's reputed to be quite strong. Available THC numbers are no higher than 16%, but reliable figures are scarce, so this strain could be substantially more potent than that. CBD makes up no more than 1% of Platinum Trainwreck, which means the strain isn't a good bet for treating conditions that require CBD preparations. But the alleged THC content makes this a great choice for treating anxiety, depression, ADHD, and chronic pain. The smell has sweet and sour notes of apple and lemon, while the flavor has similar hints of apple. The appearance of the bud reflects the name, with light green leaves, amber hairs, and a silver sheen of resinous trichomes. Platinum Trainwreck has few widely reported adverse effects, but patients should expect the usual: dry mouth, dry eyes, and possible paranoia. This strain is a unique regional specialty found almost exclusively on Arizona's medical marijuana market."
Platinum 44 Strain,"Platinum 44 is an indica dominant hybrid strain with unknown genetics due to its rarity on the medicinal market. Although its parentage is unknown, Platinum 44 has been measured at having an average THC level of 18% on average and a low average CBD level of approximately 0.24%. This bud gets its name from its bright silvery color that comes from a thick coating of sparkling crystal trichomes. The nugs are round and dense in nature with a dark green coloration and purple undertones that are exposed once the nugs are broken apart. This bud has an intense flavor of sweet earthy flavors accented by spicy pungency. The aroma is of rich fruity earthy flavors that are accented by herbs and spices. The Platinum 44 high is very body heavy in nature due to its indica dominance. It starts with a mild euphoric effect that leaves you uplifted yet incredibly calm. This is accompanied by a slowly building numbing body buzz that immediately erases any physical or mental pain, leaving you utterly relaxed and at ease. These effects make Platinum 44 ideal for use at night by patients who suffer from conditions such as insomnia, chronic stress or anxiety, migraines or headaches, and chronic pain."
Yogi Strain,Yogi is a strong Indica dominant hybrid strain produced by mating
Cascade Delight Strain,"This organic cut of Portland Dogshit is nothing if not hard to find. It may be available in a handful of legal dispensaries, but it's unusual even there. Portland Dogshit is itself a rarity, and not much is known about it or its descendant. But Cascade Delight is known to be an indica-dominant hybrid. The exact ratio of indica to sativa is unclear, as are the specifics of THC and CBD content. But the aroma and taste are a clear gift from the Dogshit parent plant, with a skunky flavor and a sweet, earthy smell. There are also hints of musk and pine. The indica body buzz is quite calming, an effective antidote for low mood and stress. Cascade Delight can be an effective treatment for anxiety, depression, mood disorders, and chronic pain. Side effects are limited, but as always, dry mouth and bloodshot eyes are possible. Like its parent, this strain is a native of the Pacific Northwest. Presumably that's the easiest place to find, especially in Oregon. But few if any legal dispensaries offer it, and it's seldom seen on the black market."
Halo OG Strain,"Some sources claim this super-strain hits THC levels of 28% or more, though those claims are doubtful. In any event, Halo OG is definitely one of the strongest strains on the planet. The CBD content is low however, less than 1%. Halo OG is a cross of Tahoe OG and Larry OG. It's an indica-dominant strain, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica is unclear. Despite its potency, this strain is relatively hard to come by. It's probably most popular in legal dispensaries on the West Coast, much harder to find on the black market or in smaller medical markets. Among other uses, Halo OG is a great source of relief for eating problems, as is induces powerful hunger and appetite. This strain is an effective treatment for anxiety, minor pain, and sleep apnea. The high hits like a freight train, with a powerful body effect that can be overwhelming to users with low tolerance. It's great for daytime activities as long as you have the capacity to stay standing. Pine is the dominant note in the taste and smell of this strain, which has a dense, sparkling appearance reflecting the think layer of trichomes on the bud."
Citrus Diesel Strain,"Citrus Diesel, also known more commonly as “Lemon Diesel,” is an indica dominant hybrid (70% indica/30% sativa) strain created through a cross of the tangy"
Cherry Frost Strain,"Cherry Frost is an indica/sativa hybrid strain with unknown parentage due to its rarity, although it is thought to be a cross of either"
Purple Lightning Strain,"Purple Lightning apparently refers to two different strains, one a modest sativa-dominant strain and the other a potent hybrid with unknown sativa/indica ratio that resulted from a cross of Trainwreck and OG Kush. The first is probably the more popular, if only because the second Purple Lightning – our version – is hard to find. THC levels are unclear, and the same is true of CBD concentrations. But the strain's appearance and lineage suggests it's quite strong. The bud is light green with strands of purple and a heavy layer of resin-soaked trichomes. The aroma is musky, with tones of lemon, pine needles, and spices, while the flavor is similar. The sativa-dominant genes of this version of Purple Lightning provide a strong cerebral punch with powerful euphoria and an energy boost. These traits make this strain perfect for treatment of depression, anxiety, physical fatigue, mood disorders, and nerve pain. Cottonmouth is the only widely reported adverse effect, though red eyes or paranoia may also occur. The other Purple Lightning is fairly easy to find, while this one is a rarity. Look on the West Coast first, but don't expect to succeed anytime soon."
Webster Strain,"Webster contains about 70 percent Sativa and 30 percent Indica, making it strong Sativa dominant hybrid cannabis. Its buds are leafy with a deep green and rust colour. Due to the dominance of the Sativa variety, this marijuana strain produces a powerful Sativa high on your system that lingers for quite some time. It has a high potency due to its moderate to high THC level. Webster energizes your body and completely relaxes your mind. It can also make you fall asleep at times. The flavour of this strain is quite strong and pungent. It is a blend of hash, woody, pine and different sweet flavours. It has a very refreshing aroma that instantly energizes you. The aroma is a mixture of fresh citrus and pine scents. Webster is a perfect fit for anxiety patients who do not find relief from any other marijuana cannabis. It soothes away all the various annoying symptoms of stress such as headaches, jitteriness and depression. In addition to being used for curing stress, you can also use it as an effective antidote for fatigue as it calms down your body and mind. You can also employ it for relieving chronic pains, upset stomach and nausea."
Master Skunk Strain,"The name of the Master Skunk Strain might put you off, but do not think for a second that this strain is anything but effective and good for you. This Master Skunk Strain has been made by Mr. Nice Seeds and is an indica dominant strain. The Master Skunk Strain is a hybrid, which is a cross between the Skunk # 1 and the Master Kush. Despite the kind of name it has, the Master Skunk Strain has a very sweet and earthy smell, which is why you should not be fooled by the name that has been attributed to it in any way. It is famous for giving a relaxing sensation to the human body and the human mind when the person makes use of it. The Master Skunk Strain is effective for people who suffer from any kind of chronic pain. The Master Skunk Strain is to be taken at night time so that its effects can be more optimal. It comes in a skunk, earthy and blue cheese kind of flavor, which sets it apart from the rest of the strains. The time taken by the Master Skunk Strain plant to grow is approximately 6 to 9 weeks."
Blue Goblin Strain,Blue Goblin is a mysterious sativa dominant hybrid strain created through a cross of the popular
Kid Strain,"The exact origins of this strain are unclear. It's not even entirely clear whether Kid leans toward sativa or indica. Its effects suggest it's a sativa-dominant hybrid, but exact ratios are unknown. THC levels are also uncertain, as are CBD concentrations. But this medical strain is recommended more for its THC content than its CBD percentages. It can be helpful in treating depression, mood disorders, irritability, anxiety, and daily stresses. The cerebral high is strongly energized, with a social boost and a healthy dose of introspective thinking. Kid has a distinctly earthy flavor, and it smells of hash and pine needles. The bud is dark green in appearance, with dark brown strands and a thin layer of trichomes. Negative effects are not widely reported, since this is a decidedly rare strain, but dry mouth is likely with most strains, and red eyes may also be possible. This strain isn't widely known outside breeder circles, but it's probably most common on the West Coast. Even there, few if any dispensaries advertise or sell it. Kid is all but unheard of on the black market in most places."
Buddha Tahoe Strain,"This medical marijuana strain, which is otherwise called as 'Buddha Tahoe Kush' was created by backcrossing OG Kush Tahoe cut, which is a forcibly growing strain. This is sometimes referred to as 'Tahoe OG (Reversed)'. Buddha Tahoe was first created by the breeding company, 'Big Buddha seeds'. This is another indica dominant strain that can be grown in both indoor and outdoor settings. The phenotypic characteristics of this strain are more or less like that of other indica strains. This was able to achieve the third place in the 'Cannabis Cup'. This was also ended up with the third spot in the overall competition as well. The plant is found to have an exceptional growth rate and the buds are found to be highly potent. The flavor that is being offered by this particular strain will be lemony in nature. Similar to the smell, the taste is also like a sublime lemon combined with an acute hash taste that is typical to Kush varieties. The strain is used for treating inflammation, multiple sclerosis and eating disorders. Buddha Tahoe is also found to be beneficial for the patients undertaking chemotherapy."
U2 Kush Strain,"U2 Kush is bred by mating Bubba Kush and Master Kush. It is a hybrid strain containing 80 percent Indica and 20 percent Sativa varieties. It has deep green coloured dense looking resinous and frosty buds that have a purple hue and orange coloured hair. Its plant is sturdy and short and takes about eight to nine weeks for its complete growth. If harvested outdoor, it finishes during the months of September of October. U2 Kush plants are convenient to rise as well. It has a high THC level that is assumed to be above 20 percent as its exact value is still not reported. Several users have reported it to be a grade A- cannabis strain. It has a lovely, mild and gentle smell that has a sweet floral and earthy scent. It is quite a good strain to smoke as well as it has a strong taste that is a blend of earthy, sweet, spicy, lavender and herbal flavours. U2 Kush has a strong and smooth smoke that casts quite an impact on your system. Its buzz stays for about two hours or slightly longer on your body. This strain is best for treating chronic pains of different types such as arthritis pains. You can also use it for stimulating your appetite and curing stress and depression."
Red Raspberry Cough Strain,"This mild, sweet sativa-dominant hybrid is nothing if not a rarity. Patients would be hard-pressed to find it anywhere, though it might appear on legal markets in the American West. It's similar in name to Strawberry Cough and other strains that cause fits of coughing, but that's about all they have in common. No one seems to know the parentage of Red Raspberry Cough, but presumably Raspberry Cough, also a sativa-dominant hybrid, was one of the parents. Don't look too hard for sources on this strain's THC or CBD content or, for that matter, its sativa/indica makeup; you won't find any. But we know the high is cerebral, with a mood boost, calming effects, and mental relief. It's a good choice in treating chronic pain, everyday stress, and anxiety. The euphoria and happiness also suggest it could help with depression and mood disorders. The flavor and smell of Red Raspberry Cough are decidedly sweet, with expected notes of raspberry, while the appearance is light green with amber strands and a light haze of trichomes on the surface. Adverse effects probably include bloodshot eyes and dry mouth, as is the case with most marijuana."
Purple African Strain,"In Africa, sativas vastly outnumber indica strains. But it's possible this rare indica-dominant hybrid descends from unknown indica parents on that continent; the truth isn't widely known. Neither is the exact ratio of sativa to indica in Purple African. THC levels likely vary considerably between crops and batches, but the few available test results peg the contents as roughly 10%. That's enough to get high, but only barely. CBD concentrations are also low, less than 1%, which means this isn't the best strain for treating seizure disorders. But it's very helpful in treating other conditions, including pain, inflammation, nausea, and insomnia. The high is calming and sleep inducing, with modest physical relaxation and pain relief. Purple African has an earthy, skunky smell and a similar taste. The frosted green-and-brown buds, covered in shimmering trichomes, belies this strain's relatively low potency. Negatives probably include dry eyes and cottonmouth, as well as possible paranoia, but there isn't much information on the subject. California is probably the most likely place to find this pleasant choice, though it may also sell elsewhere on the West Coast. It definitely isn't popular, though."
Tiny Bomb Strain,"Tiny Bomb, also known as ""The Incredible Tiny Bomb"" to some members of the cannabis community, is an extremely rare sativa dominant hybrid (70% sativa/30% indica) strain that is a reworked phenotype of the insanely popular Space Queen strain. This dank bud was created by breeders at TGA Genetics and boasts an average THC level ranging from 14-23%. The Tiny Bomb has a distinct aroma of sour pungent fruit and a taste that has been described as extremely sour fruity candies that have gone bad. This bud has thick airy popcorn-shaped minty green nugs with purple undertones, orange hairs, and a thin layer of trichomes and resin. Users describe the Tiny Bomb high as one that slowly creeps up on you, leaving you slightly upbeat and increasingly motivated and happy. You'll feel a fast-onset of gratifying pain relief in both mind and body followed by an intense rush of energy and motivation that peaks after about an hour or so. Upon the comedown, you'll feel lethargic and lazy with slight tendencies towards couch-lock and the munchies. Due to these potent indica and sativa effects, Tiny Bomb is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as fatigue, pain, stress, and anxiety disorders."
Rishi Kush Strain,"Rishi Kush is a mild medical option for patients suffering from anxiety, glaucoma, and everyday stress. It's ideal for patients and recreational users who are new to marijuana or otherwise have low tolerance. THC levels vary between 11% and slightly more than 17%, but tend to be on the low end of that range. This strain's parents come from the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan and the cannabis fields of North India, though the specific strains are unclear. It's said to be an even hybrid, with a sativa/indica ratio of roughly 50:50, and that balance shows in the modest high, which is both physically calming and mentally focused. Reported CBD levels are very low in Rishi Kush, meaning it isn't recommended as primary treatment for seizures or other health problems that respond to that chemical. With a sweet, fruity lemon smell, this strain produces leafy green buds with light brown hairs. Negative effects likely include cottonmouth and dry eyes, though there isn't much public information on the subject. It's not clear where this strain can be found, but it definitely isn't popular in the United States."

Most importantly, it is recognized as being one of the strongest sativa strains available in the market. A soon as you smoke the strain, you will realize the high has a charged buzz.

Old School Haze Strain,"Old School Haze is a pure sativa strain with an astounding 25% THC content. It is well known for offering an everlasting high and produces incredibly dense buds. Each nugget is considerably larger than any other strain you may have medicated with before and is light green in color. However, you will notice small traces of brown hairs seeping through the trichomes as well. As for the smell and taste, it is hazy and very Kush like. Even though it is seems to be nothing out of the ordinary, it will keep you coming back for more after the first hit. As mentioned earlier, the high is everlasting, the effects can easily last you for hours. In fact it is one of the few strains that last for hours on without breaking a sweat. Moreover, it is incredibly potent, a few hits or so are more than enough to leave you euphoric, happy, relaxed and hungrier than ever before. You may exhibit symptoms of couch-lock as well, which is why it would be wise to use it as an evening time smoke. Considering its effects, the strain is incredibly useful for patients with medical conditions like depression, PTSD, muscle spasms and loss of appetite."
Space Needle Strain,Space Needle is a 100% pure sativa strain that is a potent cross between the insanely popular
Beaver Dawg Strain,"Beaver Dawg is a lovely CBD-rich indica allegedly created by cultivators at the University of Oregon (the Beavers) and the University of Washington (the Huskies) – hence the name. Even in those places, though, this is not an easy strain to find. Dispensaries are increasingly selling strains high in CBD, so Beaver Dawg might gradually become more common in coming years. THC levels are low, less than 2% in some tests, while CBD levels top at least 4%, making this strain ideal for treating pediatric epilepsy and some other childhood illnesses. Some sources say Beaver Dawg is sativa-dominant, other that it's indica-dominant. But it delivers a calming, energized body buzz that suggests it's more indica than sativa (exact ratio unknown). This strain can treat seizures, but it's also good for nausea and pain. Of course, it's a bad choice for patients who require a THC high. Beaver Dawg has a fresh, mild, earthy taste and a mild pine smell. Negative effects are likely to include red eyes and cottonmouth. Look exclusively in the Pacific Northwest for this unusual medical strain; it's a local specialty."

Sweet Thai Strain,"Sweet Thai is a sativa-dominant cross of Super Tai and an unknown early Skunk variety, possibly Skunk #1. It has a sativa/indica ratio of at least 70:30. It's unclear where exactly this strain got its name, as its flavor and aroma aren't especially sweet: The smell is fruity but also spicy, and the taste is smooth, musky, and spicy. THC levels vary widely, with available tests suggesting a range of roughly 10%-18%. CBD levels, on the other hand, are higher than average but still not very high, slightly less than 1%. That means Sweet Thai may not be the best choice for alleviating symptoms that respond to CBD, such as seizures, so talk with your doctor and budtender before using it for that purpose.

The strain is derived from motivation cannabis seeds which have an ancestry with Warlock and Sensi Star. Motivation marijuana belongs to the family of various Indica strains and offers a high potency dose which has the ability to knock any smoker's socks off.

Lavender Goo Strain,"CBD levels are low in this cross of Lavender and Goo – both indicas – but THC levels are very high. Lavender Goo is an indica-dominant hybrid, though the precise ratio of sativa to indica isn't widely known. The actual THC count can exceed 20%, while CBD doesn't reach 1%. In other words, this isn't the best strain for treating symptoms that respond to CBD. Indeed, it's not entirely clear what medical benefits this rare strain has. Based on its indica genes, it can presumably help patients with anxiety relax, and may be effective in treating pain. It may also be used to treat insomnia. The high is likely centered on the body, but that isn't clear, either. Neither are the potential side effects of Lavender Goo, though dry mouth at least is likely. Likewise, there are few reports describing the taste or smell of this strain, though lavender seems to be the dominant note. The buds are very dense and have a dark purple appearance. This strain really isn't common anywhere, though it might be found on some legal medical markets in the United States."

The positive effects said to occur from this strain include becoming clear- headed, sleepiness, a feeling of calm, and a strong, relaxing body buzz.

Cannalope AK Strain,"The sativa genes win out in this rare medical selection (sativa/indica ratio of about 30:70), promising a heady high that may be helpful in alleviating the symptoms of patients suffering from anxiety, depression, or mood disorders. Beyond that, there isn't much public data on this strain or its potential medical uses. There also isn't much specific information on the type of high created by Cannalope AK, or on how much THC or CBD is contained in the strain. But Cannalope AK descends from two potent sativa-dominant hybrids, Cannalope and AK-47, so the experience is likely head-focused with some physical relaxation provided by the indica genes. Cannalope and AK-47 are both widely popular and typically very powerful. Hybrids don't always capture the potency of their parent plants, but if Cannalope AK is as at least as strong as they are, it should make for a strong choice with THC levels potentially exceeding 20%. There's little if any information on the taste and smell of this strain, or on its appearance. This strain might be found on some American legal markets, but it certainly isn't common. It may be somewhat easier to find on the black market."
Deadhead x Durban Strain,"Deadhead X Durban is an insanely rare sativa dominant hybrid (85% sativa/15% indica) strain that is a potent cross between the hugely popular Deadhead OG X Durban Poison strains. The parent strains are two ranked buds from High Times' ""Earth's Strongest Strains"" in 2012, giving this strain a potent boost from the get-go, leading to an insane THC level ranging from 26-28% on average. Users describe the high from Deadhead X Durban as a euphoric, uplifted energetic head high that leaves you feeling buzzed and happy before fading into a sleepy and sedative couch-lock.

Due to these potent effects, Deadhead X Durban is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as insomnia, chronic pain, stress disorders, and depression. This dank bud has dense popcorn-shaped neon green nugs with purple and dark green undertones and a speckling of thin, fiery orange and rich amber hairs. These nugs are caked in a layer of fine frosty trichomes and a thin coating of sticky sweet resin. Deadhead X Durban has a pungent earthy aroma with hints of skunk, and a taste that is of pungent earthy pine with a sweet skunky taste that intensifies as you exhale."
Charlie OG Kush Strain,"Despite the name, Charlie OG Kush isn’t really a “kush” strain. Rather, it’s a sativa dominant hybrid (80% sativa/20% indica) strain with unknown parentage due to breeder secrecy. However, it is thought to be a cross of Chemdawg and Hindu Kush, perhaps with a hint of Lemon Thai. Regardless, Charlie OG Kush has set the genetic foundation for many strains in the Western region of the United States. No matter its parentage, the Charlie OG Kush high is definitely an uplifting eye-opening experience. You’ll feel euphoric and relaxed as your mental and physical pain simply melt away with a buzzing calming effect. Your body will slowly be overcome by a sedative body high as your mind begins to soar with clear-headed effects.

It has a classic skunky flavor with hints of earthy pungency and an aroma of pungent earthy spice that has a slightly herbal tinge to it."
Alakazam Strain,"Alakazam is an evenly balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain created by breeders at the infamous Seed Makers. This rare strain has unknown genetics, as its creators keep it hidden from the cannabis community and boasts a THC level ranging from 18-20% on average. Alakazam is well-known for its appearance: it has dark olive green and rich purple buds with long furry deep purple hairs. These nugs are dense, dripping with sweet sticky resin, and covered in a thick layer of fine white trichomes. Alakazam has an aroma that is of warm melted buttery sugar and a taste of smooth caramel that sweetens as you exhale. This dank strain offers the user an immediate cerebral head high that leaves them euphoric and with significant mind relief. This initial high is followed by full, deep body relaxation that leaves the user relaxed, relieved, and couch-locked. Alakazam has a narcotic effect that slowly eases the user into a deep and peaceful sleep, making it an ideal strain for night use. Due to its potent combination of mind and body relief, this strain is ideal for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress and anxiety, such as PTSD and phobias, chronic pain due to injury or illness, and sleep disorders, including apnea and insomnia."
Blue Northern Strain,"Blue Northern may sound more like a freight railroad than a marijuana strain, but it's a crossbreed of two beloved, extremely potent indicas: Blueberry, which has THC levels that can reach 24%, and Northern Lights, which has a top THC concentration of 26%. Like its ancestors, Blue Northern is dominated by indica genes (sativa/indica ratio of 30:70), but not much is known about its THC or CBD levels. Still, it's likely quite strong, given its parentage. This strain has a distinct berry flavor and an aroma of strawberries. A few quick puffs lead to deep body relaxation, with a dreamy euphoria and limited cerebral effects. Save this strain for late at night, as it's ideal for treating insomnia or putting a troubling day in the past. Blue Northern can effectively treat both pain and sleeplessness, while some users may also find relief for anxiety or other mental health disorders. As for side effects, dry mouth and bloodshot eyes are probably the most common, though there are few reports of any kind about this strain. Blue Northern might be found on the West Coast and in Colorado, but it would be hard to find even there."
Kaya's Koffee Strain,Kaya's Koffee is a slightly indica dominant hybrid (55% indica/45% sativa) strain crated through a cross of the classic
Snowdizzle Strain,"This highly rated strain is a product of Pre-98 Bubba Kush and Snowdawg 2, both indicas. Snowdizzle is also predominantly indica (sativa/indica ratio of 25:75), a fact reflected in the body high it produces. There isn't an extraordinary amount of THC in this strain, though exact amounts are hard to come by. CBD contents are unknown, but this strain isn't the best choice for alleviating symptoms that respond to that cannabinoid. The flavor is sweet, delicate, and pleasing. Snowdizzle tastes and smells of coffee, lemon, and strawberry. The body buzz is also quite pleasing, with deep relaxation and calming effects. Beyond that, not much is known about how this strain affects users. It's recommended as an effective treatment for migraine headaches, nausea, pain, and insomnia. Snowdizzle is best reserved for late at night because of its sedating effects. There are few public reports of negatives when smoking this strain, though dry mouth is probably the most likely. Finding Snowdizzle could prove to be a formidable task, as it isn't widely available. But it's easier to get on the legal medical market than the black market."
Dess*tar Strain,"Dess*tar, aka Desstar, is a sativa-dominant hybrid that descends from Star Ship and Kali Mist. THC levels are unknown, as are CBD levels, but this is a fairly potent strain with energizing effects. The exact ratio of sativa to indica is unknown, but Kali Mist is nearly 100% sativa and Star Ship is an indica-dominant hybrid. Desstar may be helpful with anxiety and depression, though its exact medical uses are largely unknown. It's not a very popular strain, so it would be hard to find almost anywhere outside the American West. And it's scarce even there. But the calming, mildly psychedelic mental high encourages focus and relaxation and may also spark creativity. This strain smells like a combination of hash and pineapple. The flavor is fruity, with haze and caramel tones. Desstar probably isn't a great choice for most medical conditions, at least until more is known about its effects. Dry mouth is probably the most likely negative effect, with other effects possible. Like many sativas and sativa-dominant hybrids, this strain is ideal for daytime activities, the serenity it causes can be helpful late at night."
Copper Kush Strain,"Lemon OG Kush and Frankenstein combine together in this 80% Indica cross. Levels of THC vary, depending on the lineage used to cross the genetics, but a content of up to 21% has been seen. The high is quickly felt in the body and the mind, promoting the ultimate in relaxation. After the quick high wears off, you can expect the buzz to settle into a comfortable state of introspection and focus. Some patients have experienced numbness and tingling sensations when medicating with this strain. Since this smoke is so relaxing, it is best suited to after the work day is finished. For those who are in a great amount of pain, it is perfect to smoke just before trying to drift off to sleep. Patients are choosing to use this strain for anxiety, pain, migraines, and stress. The aroma itself is very pungent, in a not unpleasant way. The top notes are very earthy and the pine can be scented and tasted easily."
Candy Skunk Strain,"Candy Skunk, also known as Kandy Skunk, is a sativa dominant hybrid (90% sativa/10% indica) that's a dank cross between the infamous"
Cheddar Head Strain,"Cheese on the head usually summons images of Wisconsin football fans. This strain probably isn't very popular there, though. In fact, it's not terribly popular anywhere. It's likely easiest to find on the West Coast or in Colorado, but even there it isn't common. With THC levels that can reach 20%, this is a relatively strong sativa-dominant hybrid (70:30 sativa/indica hybrid). CBD levels are low, though just how low isn't clear. There's another strain by the same name, though that is a pure sativa with lower THC and CBD levels. Cheddar Head is ideal for treating depression and chronic pain, as well as anxiety. The high is relaxed but stimulating, with a boost of energy. Despite its name, this strain doesn't taste or smell like cheddar cheese. Rather it has a sugary sweet aroma and a fruity candy flavor with hints of berries. Cheddar Head is a crossbreed of Exodus Cheese and Snowdawg 2. Its popularity is limited, though it's probably easiest to find on the West Coast and in Colorado. It's usually scarce on the black market, though local cultivators will sometimes cross Exodus and Snowdawg without knowing Cheddar Head already exists."

It was created in the Netherlands and has become a delightful favorite among cannabis users. This strain offers a fast high that moves into a euphoric state of mind. The THC is highly concentrated so you only need a small amount of the product to create those feelings. This strain of cannabis offers a sweet taste that is very inviting and smooth.

Although it's not known whether Nine Point Sugar is a sativa dominant or indica dominant strain, it is often thought to be indica dominant due to its more potent body relaxing high. Users describe the high as a pretty even mix of indica and sativa, with an immediate onset of a mellow sativa cerebral head high that is euphoric and energizing with a hint of inspired creativity. This is followed by a slowly creeping potent body high that leaves you couch locked and utterly relaxed. With a THC level that ranges from 12-18% on average, this bud is ideal for smoking day or night. Nine Point Sugar is infamous in the cannabis community for its frosty appearance – its crystal-coated body has a thick snowy white coat of trichomes over a minty green, dense popcorn shaped nug that is leafy and fluffy.

Sweet Blue Strain,"There are rare marijuana strains and then there are strains so rare you can't say much of anything about them with any certainty. Sweet Blue is one of those strains, a truly hard-to-find medical choice that combines an unclear sativa heredity with unknown indica genes (sativa/indica ratio not widely available). There are so few public reports about this strain that it's impossible to gauge its THC or CBD content. That means it's also impossible to say with any confidence what medical conditions can be treated with Sweet Blue, though the lack of details suggests it's a poor choice as front-line treatment for seizures or other problems that respond to CBD. It's also hard to make even an educated guess about what kind of effects users can expect to experience – physical or cerebral, mild or strong, quick or long lasting. There is likewise no public data on the taste, smell, or appearance of Sweet Blue. And its parentage is yet another mystery. So is the availability of this strain: It may exist in the American West, but it's probably mostly found in the backyards of a handful of amateur growers."

The Bob Strain,"No, not Bob Marley. This complex sativa-heavy hybrid, which has a sativa/indica ratio of at least 70:30, was created in homage to the great comedic genius Bob Saget of ""Full House"" legend. It's a combination of Ft. Collins (aka FoCo), S.A.G.E. (itself a mix of Big Sur Holy and an Afghani), and finally Hanis (a purple Kunduz Afghani joined with Pre-'98 Bubba Kush and 1994 Positronics Haze). All those crossbred genes make for a powerful head high with psychoactive effects and a strong, unique mood boost. The Bob is reputedly quite potent, but it's hard to find any solid numbers to back that claim. Still, it's definitely popular among those who have tried it. CBD numbers are likewise scarce, meaning this strain isn't recommended as treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that require CBD preparations. The Bob has a dank, chemical flavor with hints of chocolate and a sweet, chemical smell. The buds are plump and frosted, with a purple, mint-green appearance. Negative effects haven't been widely reported, but red eyes and cottonmouth are safe bets. The Bob doesn't appear to be a big seller much of anywhere; if anything, it's very rare."

It has a fruit-like aroma and taste as well, with a hint of spice that tingles your taste buds at the end. Irrespective of the myth linked to this medical strain, it is undoubtedly a fantastic strain for patients in need. This Sativa became the most popular medical strain, because of its associated tale and its high potency value. It is known for providing a patient with relaxation alongside drowsiness. It is extensively prudent for patients suffering from gastrointestinal disorder, spinal cord injury, depression and migraine-oriented symptoms. Conversely, it may cause drying eyes, a dehydrated mouth and headaches could occur, depending on the uptake capacity of the patient.

Ultra Lemon Haze Strain,"Ultra Lemon Haze is a blend of two stellar sativa-dominant strains, the Cannabis Cup-winning Lemon Haze and a select batch of Sour Diesel. This strain is sativa-heavy itself, but the exact ratio of sativa to indica isn't widely available.

The high is distinctly psychedelic, a combination of body buzz and soaring, euphoric cerebral effects that derive mostly from the dominant sativa genes. Ultra Lemon Haze produces a spectacular smoke that tastes and smells of tart lemons and citrus fruit, with strong chemical hints of diesel fuel. This strain is certainly popular among those patients who have tried it, but they're relatively few and far between.

Swedish Nectar Strain,"Don't go looking for this rare treat in Scandinavia; marijuana is still illegal there, and the country isn't exactly known for its cannabis exports. That's fitting, given how hard it is to find much of any data on Swedish Nectar. It's a sativa-dominant hybrid that delivers mostly cerebral effects, but the precise ratio of sativa to indica is unknown, as are the THC and CBD contents of this strain. It is rumored to be a fairly potent strain, but definitely not one of the strongest. The sativa genes make it a decent choice for treating depression, fatigue, lack of appetite, and undesired weight loss.

Blue Moonshine Strain,"Never drink blue moonshine, but definitely take a hit of the indica-heavy Blue Moonshine if you get the chance. THC levels are nothing extraordinary, topping 13% in some tests, but that makes this a great medical choice for occasional tokers and first-timers. The pungent fruity flavor and aroma, reminiscent of blueberries and citrus, give this strain the Blue half of its name. The Moonshine part comes from additional notes of fermentation in the taste and smell. No one seems to know much about what plants gave rise to Blue Moonshine, and the same is true of the exact balance of sativa to indica. CBD levels are very low, too low to recommend this strain to patients who suffer from epileptic conditions and other disorders that respond to that chemical. Expect a calming, euphoric body high with sleepiness, a tingling sensation, and a boost of creativity. Use Blue Moonshine as effective treatment for anxiety, depression, mood disorders, muscle spasms, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress.

The high is equally potent, providing intensely euphoric, calming, and clear-headed cerebral effects that may be useful in treating anxiety, low mood, chronic physical pain, and stress. But CBD concentration is reportedly less than 1%, and that is much too low to recommend this strain as the exclusive treatment for severe seizure disorders and other health conditions that can be alleviated using CBD. The leaves of Blueberry Hash's nugs have a medium green hue and are covered with a layer of resinous trichomes. This strain tastes and smells of berries and other sweet fruits.

It will clear your mind and thus allow you to stay focused on the task at hand. The strain offers a body and cerebral buzz but it does not tire you regardless of how much of the strain you have already smoked. Moreover, you will neither have to worry about exhibiting symptoms of couch-lock. You will feel refreshed nonetheless.

Gog & Magog Strain,"There isn't much information available about this indica-dominant hybrid. The sativa/cannabis ratio is 20:80, so Gog & Magog delivers a high concentrated mostly on the body. Users should find this strain relaxing and calming, though specifics of its effects are largely unknown. But it's a powerful strain, with high THC levels, though, again, exact details are unknown. The same goes for CBD content, but Gog & Magog is indicated as a treatment because of its THC content rather than its CBD levels. This hard-to-find this strain can be used to treat nausea, pain, inflammation, and intraocular pressure (glaucoma). A native of Israel, Grog & Magog is named after two historical figures first mentioned in the Old Testament and later in both Christian and Muslim texts. Early Jewish writers used Gog, a Scythian who invaded Israel more than 2,500 years ago, as a Gentile foil. Over the centuries, the term ""Gog and Magog"" came to be associated with the apocalypse, a link pushed even further with the marijuana strain. The high this strain provides is body-oriented, best reserved for late at night. Use of this strain can lead to dry mouth, though it's unclear if there are other unwanted effects. There's little data on the taste, smell, or appearance of this Middle Eastern original."

Because of this, it's an ideal treatment for manic depression, fatigue and muscle spasms, as it relaxes the body without causing couch-lock and stimulates the mind.

The strain is a creeper nonetheless. The effects will hit you when you least expect it. The high starts off with feelings of euphoria which then transforms into a body stone.

Humboldt Strain,"This sativa-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio unknown) pays homage to Northern California's marijuana heartland. Humboldt County, together with Mendocino and Trinity counties, is part of the famed Emerald Triangle, the largest cannabis-cultivating locale in America.

Humboldt can be used to treat depression, headaches, anxiety, insomnia, and lack of appetite. Its CBD levels are apparently quite low, however, so this isn't the best option for treating conditions that respond to that chemical, including epilepsy and other seizure disorders.

CBD levels are another story, though, rating no more than 0.5% in publicly available tests. That means patients shouldn't rely on Kushashima as the only source of marijuana treatment for seizure disorders such as epilepsy. This strain isn't terribly versatile as a medical tool; its only recommended use is as treatment for insomnia. That's because the indica body high is sleepy and spacey, perfect for nodding off late at night. Most strains are useful in treating anxiety and mood problems, and Kushashima may be good at that as well. This train has a pungent aroma of pine needles and wood, with a similar flavor. There are few widely reported side effects, but dry mouth, dry eyes, and paranoia are typically the most common. The bud is green with orange hairs.

There are few reported side effects, though bloodshot eyes are likely and paranoia is possible. Mercury OG is sold on the legal medical markets in California and British Columbia, but it's not very common elsewhere.

But then again the strain is perfect for individuals suffering aches and pains and anxiety. Also depending on the user, in some cases Millennium has been prescribed for patients with eating disorders, migraines, inflammation, muscle spasms and PMS. However, it is better used for evening time use."

Nuggetry OG is quite big in size and looks like a huge stone of emerald green color with wild orange hair. They have Trichomes that are of a golden amber color.

It typically appears with hues of purple on the leaves, and light and dark green covering the buds and nugs."
OCD Strain,"OCD ranks high among those who have tried it, thanks to its potent THC levels and energizing sativa high. A Seattle original, this strain is essentially impossible to find anywhere else, unless maybe it cycles on the black market. And you'd be lucky to stumble across it even there. No one seems to know the exact ratio of sativa to indica in this plant, though the sativa is clearly dominant. Nor is it clear which strains OCD descends from. But we do know THC levels are relatively high, while CBD levels are probably quite low. It certainly isn't known as a CBD strain, so don't use it to treat seizures or other problems that are helped by CBD. The head high is creative and energized, with upbeat euphoric effects. Dry mouth and paranoia are both commonly reported, while red eyes and dizziness are also possible. Use this strain as an effective treatment for nausea, chronic pain, and lack of appetite. It can also help with migraines and sleeplessness. OCD allegedly has a smell of burned peanut butter, but details on the aroma and flavor are hard to find."
OG Eddy Lepp Strain,"OG Eddy Lepp is an indica dominant strain that won 2nd place in the High Times Cannabis Cup in 2013. Even though there is very little known about its genetics, it is incredibly potent. The buds are dense and dark brown with hints of green and orange hairs. The strain has a very woody and earthy aroma along with a tropical taste, which should make it a must try for cannabis users and patients alike. The high is exceptionally good due to its impressive CBD levels. It has calming cerebral effects that will gradually relax your body. However, you will get the urge to stick to your couch all the while feeling extremely euphoric. Additionally, you should not be surprised if you feel creative as it may feel a bit strange at first. Moreover, it would be a good idea to keep some snacks around to counter the munchies. That being said, the strain is equally effective at treating various medical conditions. This is perhaps one of the most important reasons why it has grown in popularity. Patients have been using OG Eddy Lepp to remedy depression, loss of appetite, stress, anxiety, and even chronic pains and aches."
Old Lyme Connecticut OG Strain,"Old Lyme Connecticut OG is a hybrid strain with a wonderful 22% THC content. The strain is one of a kind and is quite fun to medicate with. The buds are incredibly dense and dark green in color. Moreover, they are smaller than any other hybrid, but are covered with a lot of crystal and orange hairs.

Organic Diesel Strain,"Organic Diesel is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain created through a cross of the powerful Diesel 48 X Diesel 77 strains. This bud is known as “organic” because its growing practices are in line with what is considered to be organic in many other industries. Organic Diesel buds have dense and oversized rounded spade shaped light minty green nugs with dark forest green nugs and fiery orange hairs. These nugs have sparse tiny trichomes and are coated with sweet sticky resin. The Organic Diesel high is a fast-hitting powerful head and body experience. It starts with a euphoric head rush that is very calming although it brings a sense of motivated energy. You’ll feel talkative and upbeat, although completely relaxed with a sense of numbing tingles that spread throughout your body. These effects in partner with its insanely powerful average THC level of up to 28% make Organic Diesel ideal for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic pain, muscle spasms, depression, seizures, and chronic stress or anxiety. The Organic Diesel flavor is very pungent in nature with a diesel and chemical flavor that’s grounded with a taste of mellow earth. The aroma is a little harsher, with diesel and ammonia smells that mix with pungent earth."
Poison Haze Strain,Poison Haze is an insanely popular 100% pure sativa strain that is a result of a cross between the infamous
P-91 Strain,"P-91 has energized effects on your system. It originates from California and is a hybrid produced by marrying Afghani with Northern Lights which is a Thai marijuana strain. It is rated as a grade A- strain by most of its users and has a strong THC level of 22 percent. It is called P-91 because it was first produced in Poway in San Diego during the year 1991. It has a slight dominance of Sativa and tends to produce psychoactive effects on its users at times. It produces its results very fast, but its impact tends to live for a short time period only. It has a mellow aroma that has a strong hint of woody and earthy flavors. Its taste is quite strong and is a blend of diesel, citrus and earthy flavors. It makes you feel extremely sleepy, giggly, happy, euphoric and energetic. P-91 is best for the medical patients of chronic pain as it helps in alleviating almost all types of severe pains, including excruciating backache. It can also be employed for finding relief from insomnia. Nausea, loss of appetite and anxiety can also be mitigated by smoking P-91. It is a safe strain, but tends to result in incredibly dry mouth and sometimes dry eyes."
Pink Pez Strain,"This indica-heavy hybrid is a cross of Pez and Sour Pink Grapefruit, though it's unclear how much of Pink Pez is sativa and how much is indica. The effects are euphoric, happy, and focused, with a sleepy sensation perfect for treating insomnia. This strain can also be used to treat anxious disorders, depression, headaches, chronic pain, and everyday stress. Some sources suggest Pink Pez as treatment for conditions that respond to CBD, including seizure disorders. But the available data suggests there isn't an awful lot of CBD in this strain, or, for that matter, THC. CBD values are well below 1%, while THC levels are below 13% in public tests. Pink Pez has a spicy flavor and a sweet grapefruit aroma, and its nugs are large, leafy, and bright green, with brown hairs and a light coating of trichomes. The adverse effects of this strain include cottonmouth, red eyes, dizziness, and anxiety. It's a Canadian original, and it's definitely hard to find outside British Columbia. Pink Pez is an ideal choice for first-time tokers who don't want to be decimated by their medication, if they can find it."
Pineapple Thai Strain,"Pineapple Thai is an extremely rare 100% pure sativa strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy. This dank bud boasts a potent average THC level that ranges from 20-24% and an insanely high CBD level that ranges from 4-5% on average. Pineapple Thai is best known for its aroma of sweet tropical pineapple and its taste of sweet tropical pineapple that becomes spicy upon exhale. These buds have small to medium-sized fluffy neon green nugs with rich gold undertones and fiery orange hairs. These nugs are dusted with a fine layer of sandy white trichomes and sweet sticky resin. Users describe the Pineapple Thai high as the perfect wake-and-bake strain due to its immediate uplifting cerebral head high effects that leave you completely pain-free with growing waves of euphoric motivated energy. These effects are long-lasting and keep you alert and focused, with hints of psychedelic effects if too much is consumed at once. Due to these potent combined THC and CBD effects, Pineapple Thai is said to be an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic pain due to injury or illness, chronic stress or anxiety, and sleep-related disorders, including insomnia and chronic fatigue."
Pure Afghan Strain,"As its name suggests, Pure Afghan is a pure indica landrace out of the Kush Mountains in Afghanistan (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100). It's relatively rare outside of that country, though it can be found on the legal markets of Amsterdam and the American Pacific Northwest. It's a mellow medical choice that can be used to treat anxiety, low mood, migraines and other headaches, lack of appetite, ADHD, inflammation, and chronic pain, as well as insomnia. The effects are calming and happy, with creativity, mental focus, and powerful hunger. THC levels aren't terribly impressive, measuring roughly 12% in publicly available tests. That means Pure Afghan may be a good choice for patients who rarely toke. It's not a good choice for people who suffer from conditions that can be treated with CBD, such as epilepsy, because that chemical is scarce in this strain. Expect an earthy, floral scent with hints of pine, and a similar flavor. Pure Afghan produces large, green, leafy buds with brown hairs. Dry mouth and paranoia appear to be the most common negative effects, but limited dry eyes and dizziness are also reported. This strain can be found in medical marijuana dispensaries between Eugene, Ore., and Vancouver, British Columbia."
Purple AK-47 Strain,"This strain is an indica-heavy cross of Granddaddy Purps and AK-47, though its exact sativa/indica ratio isn't widely known. Despite the indica dominance, Purple AK-47 delivers a complex combination of head and body effects: physical relaxation, sleepiness, happiness, euphoria, and an intense tingly sensation. It has many medical uses, including treatment for anxiety, depression, eye pressure, headaches, inflammation, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. Purple AK-47 contains no more as much as 18% THC, making it a relatively potent choice for medical or recreational users. CBD levels, on the other hand, are less than 2%, so this strain isn't an ideal tool in treating seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to that chemical. The smell and flavor of Purple AK-47 have sweet notes of honey, pine trees, and plums, while the nugs are bright green and purple with brown hairs and a layer of crystals. The most commonly reported side effects are dry mouth, red eyes, dizziness, and limited paranoia. This strain sells mostly in California, Michigan, and Oregon, though it can also sometimes be found on the black market."
Purple Hashplant Strain,"Purple Hashplant is an evenly-balanced hybrid with a combination of cerebral and body effects (it has a sativa/indica ratio of roughly 50:50). The high is hungry and creative yet lazy and calming, euphoric and giggly yet sleepy at the same time. That makes this a solid choice for medicating sleep disorders, lack of appetite, anxiety, migraine headaches, chronic pain, and stress. But it's not such a good selection for patients who suffer from severe seizure disorders or other maladies that require CBD, as the concentration of that chemical is very low, judging by the lack of publicly available test results. THC levels are also hard to determine, yet there is no reason to think Purple Hashplant is either especially potent or especially weak. It produces a fruity berry aroma and a similar taste, while the buds are dark green and purple with orange hairs. Adverse effects include dry eyes and dry mouth, but other negatives appear to be less likely. Though Purple Hashplant has its fans, it isn't particularly popular anywhere; still, it might be found at medical marijuana dispensaries in California's Inland Empire."
Purple Sage Strain,"Though often pegged as an even hybrid, Purple Sage in fact appears to have a sativa/indica ratio of roughly 35:65. It's believed to be a descendant of SAGE and an unknown purps mix. The high hits both head and body, mixing creativity, euphoria, mental focus, happiness, and drowsiness. Though THC levels are somewhat modest, reaching 16% in publicly available tests, Purple Sage is a pleasant choice for part-time tokers and other users with low tolerance. It can be used to treat depression, anxiety, nausea, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. But the available information suggests CBD levels are very low, less than 1%, which means Purple Sage isn't the best choice for treating conditions that are relieved with that chemical, such as severe epileptic disorders. Sweet notes of sage and lemon dominate the smell and flavor of this strain, while the buds are light green with brown hairs. The only widely reported adverse effects are dry mouth and dry eyes, though others may be possible. Purple Sage is popular enough among those who have tried it, but it definitely isn't widespread. Colorado is probably the best place to look for it."
PVC OG Strain,"This indica-dominant strain (sativa/indica ration unknown) is almost certainly a descendant of the original OG Kush, but beyond that not much is known about its heredity. PVC OG is the private creation of Positive Vibrations Collective in Long Beach, Cal., and that's about the only place on Earth where patients are likely to find it. The amount of THC and CBD in this strain is something of a mystery, though published reviews suggest it's relatively potent with THC. The paucity of information about CBD contents means this strain probably shouldn't be relied upon as exclusive treatment for seizure conditions. Instead, PVC is good medication for anxiety, ADHD, muscle spasms, chronic pain, and everyday stress. The high is mostly physical, with mental clarity, a dose of euphoria, and a tingly sensation throughout the body. This strain has an earthy, floral smell and a similar taste. The buds are purple and green with orange hairs and dense crystals. There are few reports of adverse effects, but users can probably expect watery eyes, cottonmouth, and possibly paranoia. PVC OG is worth trying if only for its subtle take on OG Kush, but unless you live near Los Angeles, you'll have to go looking for it."
Purple Tonic Strain,Purple Tonic is a 100% pure indica hybrid strain created as a cross of the deliciously potent
Red Dwarf Strain,"Red Dwarf is an extremely rare 100% pure indica strain created by breeders at the infamous Buddha Seeds farms as a dank cross between a White Dwarf phenotype X Ruderalis. This strain is not usually bred due to its low THC content, which ranges from 7-15% on average, but is rather grown for its ability to reach adulthood within a 6-week span. Due to its small size, Red Dwarf is an ideal strain for indoor breeders to grow who don't have very much room to spare. This bud smokes like an indica, leaving you feeling instantly sedated and at ease with mild couch-lock that won't completely knock you out. You'll feel relaxed yet spacey and easily distracted with a mellow case of the munchies. Due to these potent indica effects, Red Dwarf is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic migraines and tension headaches, chronic pain due to injury or illness, and appetite loss. Red Dwarf has dense arrowhead-shaped light minty green nugs with rich amber hairs and undertones and dark olive green leaves. These nugs are hairy and caked in milky white trichomes. These nugs have an aroma of skunky floral coffee and a taste of rich floral java with a skunky exhale."
Q3 Strain,"Q3 is a rare sativa-dominant strain, though the precise ratio of sativa to indica genes isn't widely known. It's an ideal daytime selection, delivering a powerful cerebral high that comes with a boost of creativity, euphoria, giggling, happiness, and increased sociability. This strain's THC levels enhance those effects, bringing potency as strong as 21% in some tests. With numbers like that, Q3 is an effective medication for treating depression, chronic pain, insomnia, and everyday stress. But the amount of CBD found in this plant is much lower, much too low to recommend it for treatment of seizures and other conditions that can be alleviated with CBD concentrates. The smell and flavor of Q3 are both fruity with hints of lemon, while the small nugs are light green with numerous orange hairs and a dense layer of frosty trichome crystals. The only widely reported negative effects from this strain are dry eyes and dry mouth, though others may be possible. Q3 is far from popular, despite the substantial punch it packs, but it may be found in at least one Denver medical marijuana dispensary."

Redding OG carries an initial hard hitting effect similar to that of Jack Frost. For people who enjoy sativa dominant strains, this is a must try. The buds of this strain break up well and carry a fresh and pleasant smell. It is not blatantly munchies and is a definite option for couch potatoes. Its popularity is mostly attributed towards the highly energized effects that if provides and the fact that it is socially popular."
Rockstar Master Kush Strain,"Don't confuse this Canadian strain with the better known Rockstar or Rockstar OG. Rockstar Master Kush is a blend of Master Kush, Sensi Star, and an Afghani indica, and is itself a strong indica (sativa/indica ratio of roughly 10:90). It's a good tool in treating tension and anxiety, a product of its calming, euphoric body high. The experience is hungry and sleepy but creative. Despite the presence of some limited sativa-like effects, this strain is best used late at night or on days with few responsibilities, as it can induce couch-lock. Use Rockstar Master Kush to treat fatigue, migraines and other headaches, inflammation, nerve pain, chronic pain, and anxiety. The flavor and aroma are a combination of earth, pine needles, and mint, while the bud has a light green appearance with brown hairs and a layer of crystals. THC levels have been measured above 15%, making this a moderately potent choice great for newcomers and occasional tokers. CBD levels are far too low to recommend Rockstar Master Kush as a treatment for seizure disorders, with test results well below 1%. This strain is mostly confined to southern British Columbia, near the border with Washington State, but may make its way to the black market on rare occasions."
Russian Rocket Fuel Strain,Russian Rocket Fuel is an indica dominant hybrid (85% indica/15% sativa) strain that is a potent cross between the hugely popular
Root Beer Kush Strain,"This regional specialty from the Great White North is hard to locate outside of British Columbia, but its heady, euphoric buzz may be worth the hunt. Its obscure origins and general scarcity also make it a good find for obscurity hounds. Though Root Beer Kush is mostly sativa, there is little available data on the exact ratio of sativa to indica in this plant. It's also hard to come by any details on cannabinoid levels, including both THC and CBD. Reports and reviews suggest the THC levels are relatively high, which means a calming but creative cerebral experience that includes a dose of euphoria, focused mental relief, and a tingling sensation. CBD, on the other hand, is not reported in large numbers, meaning this strain probably shouldn't be used as the only source of treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that require CBD. But Root Beer Kush is known to be an effective treatment for anxiety, depression, migraines and other headaches, nausea, insomnia, and everyday stress. Dry eyes and cottonmouth are the only widely reported negative side effects. The flavor and aroma of Root Beer Kush are earthy with sweet notes of orange, strawberry, and vanilla."
Seattle Blue Strain,"Not surprisingly, Seattle Blue is a hometown original from the Pacific Northwest. It can still be found there, and in California, but elsewhere it definitely isn't common. The genetics and parentage of this strain are unclear, though it is known to be an intense indica (exact sativa/indica ratio unknown). That indica dominance shows through in the intense body high, which is euphoric, happy, and hungry, making this an ideal selection for patients who want to treat wasting and eating disorders. The physical buzz is also complemented by cerebral creativity and mental focus. Seattle Blue is a good choice for alleviating the symptoms of several conditions: anxiety, depression, mood disorders, migraines and other headaches, muscle spasms, chronic pain, insomnia, and everyday stresses. With THC levels that can top 20%, it's a potent medical choice. CBD levels, however, are very low, almost nonexistent. So this strain shouldn't be relied upon as the only means of treating conditions that respond to CBD. Expect a sweet, fruity smell and flavor, with hints of soil and flowers. Cottonmouth and red eyes are the most common negative effects, while paranoia and dizziness are also possible."
Sapphire Star Strain,"This hybrid is a cross of God Bud, an indica, and Good Hawaiian, a sativa-dominant hybrid. It's easy to find – if you live in Arizona. Otherwise, you'll have a hard time getting your hands on Sapphire Star. It's sativa-dominant, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica isn't clear. Likewise, there's only limited information on THC and CBD levels, though there's little evidence to suggest either is especially high. Sapphire Star and its happy cerebral effects make for an effective way to treat anxiety, low mood, irritability, and stress. With uncertain CBD contents, though, it probably isn't a great choice for alleviating seizure disorders or other illnesses that respond to CBD. Expect a limited body buzz and clear-headed mental effects, including euphoria, focused thinking, an energy boost, and increased creativity. Sapphire Star tastes and smells of berries, with a sour, Skunky aroma and a sour flavor with hints of wood. No negative effects are widely reported, though that probably reflects this strain's rarity than its lack of side effects. This strain sells on the Arizona medical market but would be much harder to find elsewhere in America."
Satori Strain,"Satori is a true hybrid medical marijuana strain which is a cross between Lucid Dreams and an unidentified sativa hybrid.

Skydog Strain,A Canadian hybrid strain that has taken off in many areas including the USA is Skydog. The actual parents vary but they are strong Indicas with some haze. The ratio is about 80:20 Indica/Sativa. The smell it offers is lemon and that is also the smooth taste it offers. The THC level can be up to 21%. This particular plant doesn't grow very tall but it does offer a nice yield. The buds are dark green in color and they form large clusters. The crystals that form on them are a light dusting but the intensity of them more than makes up for the lack of volume. Skydog offers a very intense high that isn't recommended for those new to the use of cannabis. Smoking it is the most common method of use. It is a dry strain so some people find it initiates coughing. It is often used by those that want a very in depth high or those that suffer from high levels of chronic pain.

It has an acceptable 19% THC content and is perfect for those individuals who are new to smoking cannabis. The buds are tight and mostly light green in color. However, you will also notice bronze hues amongst the greens. Crystal OG tastes and smells differently from one another, which is a rare quality to come across in a sativa dominant strain. It smells sweet and piney all the while delivering smooth and fuel flavors for you to enjoy. As soon as you smoke the strain, you will fall into a dreamy state. You will feel calm and relaxed due to the body numbing effects of the strain. It should be kept in mind that the strain can easily put you to sleep, which is why it is recommended for use as a nighttime strain. But then again, as long as you remain active, you will be able to get things done comfortably. The high is great and keeps you vitalized and its effects tend to last for quite some time. That being said, the strain is equally effective at treating various medical conditions including stress, chronic pains, depression, anorexia, muscle spasms and migraines."

Donk has a soapy, hashy taste with a berry aftertaste upon inhale, and a candy berry exhale that is smooth as silk. This delicious bud has a sweet, floral smell with undertones of strawberry and raspberry. The Donk buds are light to medium green in color with furry orange hairs and are extremely dense and solid. These nugs are drenched in resin, incredibly sticky to the touch, and covered in a thick layer of sugary crystal trichomes."
Deep Cheese Strain,"Deep Cheese is the result of selective inbreeding of the famed Cheese strain. Cheese has a 20:80 sativa/indica ratio, so Deep Cheese has a strong indica component that gives a relaxed high. But there's enough sativa in this hybrid to stimulate the creative mind, too. The THC content of Deep Cheese is moderate at best, though it's hard to find any solid information about THC levels. It's not easy to get hold of this strain, either, as it's relatively new and, like other Cheese sub-strains, is bred mostly for its distinctive cheese flavor. Deep Cheese has an unusual sour smell, also reminiscent of cheese. The original Cheese strain is best used for its relaxing effects, and that's true of Deep Cheese as well. But this strain also delivers a mood boost and creative energy to complement the body high. It's most effective in treating anxiety and depression, as well as chronic pain. Deep Cheese is a rather obscure strain, so it isn't very popular outside of Europe. It comes from a Spanish seed bank named Dinafem, which describes the high as an ""average effect, both physical and mental."""

As the strain is quite intense, novice smokers must take it slow and consume smaller doses in the beginning."
Dr. Grinspoon Strain,"Dr. Grinspoon is among the pure sativa medical marijuana strains and as an honor to Dr. Lester Grinspoon. He is a world famous great researcher, advocate and author who was also a Harvard professor. This medical marijuana strain which was produced by 'Barneys Farm' is the second prize winner of 'Cannabis Cup'. This plant tends to develop thinner and taller. Upon maturing, the cola of this marijuana strain would appear like small green and red colored beads. The plant would appear similar to berries over the stem. The THC levels of this particular strain would range from 20% to 25%, while the CBD level is 0.4%. The aroma that is being given out of the buds will be lemony whereas the aroma of the smoke is mild and tangy combined with fruity smells. This particular strain would offer a long-standing, heavy cerebral high to the users. Hence, this is found to be a good strain for patients who are fighting mental disorders and will be a fine mood elevator. Moreover, Dr. Grinspoon would help in alleviating mood disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and pain."
Draztic Strain,"Draztic is a 100% pure indica strain whose breeders have mysteriously kept its genetics hidden. This insanely dank bud boasts an insanely potent 3-4 hour length of high and a moderate 15-18% THC level on average. Typical of any indica strain, the Draztic high is often described by patients to be an immediate onset of a head high that's very cerebral, focused, and uplifting. However, this strain is also known for its giggly effects – following the uplifting cerebral high, users are immediately stricken with an intense case of the giggles. Because of these euphoric elevating effects, Draztic is often used to treat patients suffering from conditions such as depression and anxiety, especially social anxiety. It has also often been used to treat chronic pain from illnesses such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. Draztic has a delicious aroma of creamy cheese mixed with a pinch of spicy pepper and cinnamon, and a taste that is reminiscent of its smell but with a slightly chemical aftertaste. This aftertaste hints that it may have parentage from the Chem strain family. Draztic bud has oversized, popcorn shaped nugs that are light green with dark green and red undertones and covered in sweet syrupy resin and a fine layer of crystal trichomes."
Eldorado Strain,"Eldorado is strong Sativa dominant hybrid cannabis that originates from Oxaca in Mexico.

You can also use it for focusing on creative projects as it clears your mind."
Emperor OG Strain,"Emperor OG is also known as Loompas Headband, but it isn't well known by any name. The few people who have tried it speak highly of it, in part because the body high hits so fast. This strain is an indica-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of no more than 30:70), a cross of the famed OG Kush, a near-even blend of sativa and indica, and Candy Kush, an indica-dominant hybrid. The indica genes in Emperor OG produce a mostly physical high with couch-lock effects, euphoria, a boost of happiness, and deep bodily relaxation. This strain frequently induces sleep, making it an ideal treatment for insomnia and other sleep disorders. It's also effective in treating anxiety, nausea, chronic pain, and everyday stress. THC levels are high but especially so, topping 15% in some tests. CBD, on the other hand, is very limited, making up substantially less than 1% of this strain. In other words, Emperor OG shouldn't be used as the sole treatment for patients with seizure disorders. The tastes and smell of this strain are sweet, with notes of earth and pine needles. Negative effects likely include dry eyes and dry mouth, though there are few available reports. Emperor OG can be bought at several California medical marijuana dispensaries, but elsewhere it's a rare find."
Elephant Stomper Strain,"This strain gets its name for the term used by tribal Africans to refer to a Kenyan landrace also known as Kilimanjaro. Unlike that pure sativa, Elephant Stomper is an even balance of indica and sativa (ratio of 50:50). It's a descendant of Purple Elephant, Grape Stomper, and Aloha White Widow, all effective strains in their own right. THC contents are unknown, as are CBD contents, but this strain is known more for its psychoactive potency than its CBD levels. Elephant Stomper delivers a combination of head and body effects, with a calming physical buzz, a dose of euphoria, and mental clarity. It's great for treating muscle spasms and pain, though it can also be helpful with anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. Elephant Stomper tastes like grapefruit and smells like flowers. Negative effects likely include cottonmouth and bloodshot eyes. But there isn't much information available on the effects of this uncommon strain, so other negatives are possible. Elephant Stomper definitely isn't popular, on or off the medical market It might be found in Amsterdam, where it's bred, but elsewhere it's rare."

The THC content exists in the range of 17.9%, whereas the indica-sativa ratio is 30:70 and the CBD level is recorded to be 3.7%. The strain is usually prescribed for morning doses with a relaxing high, which tends to last long. Therefore, it is often recommended to ease tension. It is not surprising to find this strain in other colours. It is used to decrease the nausea and stress in the body and mind. However, it is used to treat pain at times. This calming strain has a euphoric feel attached to it as a bonus. Moreover, it tastes and smells like fruit adding to the delicacy of the species as potential consumers may expect."
Free Leonard Strain,"Free Leonard is an indica dominant hybrid strain that is incredibly potent and has to plenty to offer for everyone. The strain has a 90:10 indica/sativa ratio and is a cross between Butterscotch Hawaiian and G13.

Free Leonard has a sensational aroma and it smells more or less the same as juicy fruit gum. On the other hand, it has a smooth taste with danky undertones. The strain offers an amazing high nonetheless and its effects can last anywhere between three to five hours. Free Leonard can cause hallucinations but apart from that there are no drawbacks. Even though the high is not enough to knock you out or put you to sleep, cannabis users are still advised to medicate with it at night.

Galactic Jack Strain,"Jack Herer crossed with Space Queen to create this sativa-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of 70:30 or more). Those genes produce a heady, cerebral high with a strong mood boost and a powerful dose of energy. The sativa dominance makes Galactic Jack a great choice for alleviating low mood, anxiety, and stress, while the indica genes provide treatment for fatigue, chronic pain, and muscle stiffness. THC levels are high, exceeding 26% in some tests. That makes this an incredibly potent choice for medication and recreation alike. CBD levels, meanwhile, are very low, less than 1% – too low to recommend this strain as a treatment for seizures or other health conditions that respond to CBD. Galactic Jack has a sweet, lemony flavor with hints of grapefruit and other citrus, and it smells of sweet lemons. The nugs are large and frosted with white trichomes. Adverse effects are likely to include dry mouth and dry eyes, along with possible paranoia, but there are few specific reports. Galactic Jack is easiest to find in California, Oregon, Washington State, and Alaska. It may also appear occasionally on the American black market, though it isn't a regular."
GDP X Purple Urkle Strain,"This no-name hybrid is a rare cross of two widely popular purple strains, Granddaddy Purps and Purple Urkle. It's an indica-dominant strain, but the precise balance of indica to sativa isn't widely reported. THC levels are reportedly high, though exact numbers are hard to come by. CBD levels, on the other hand, are unclear, which rules this out as a good choice for treating seizure disorders. The effects are described as intensely physical and very potent. This strain hits instantly, like a brick, and can last for hours. It's deeply relaxing and can induce powerful couch-lock. Use this hybrid to treat nausea, nerve pain, chronic pain, insomnia, stiffness, and anxiety. GDP X Purple Urkle tastes and smells like its double-Purps lineage would suggest: grapey and dank, with notes of blackberries and berries generally. The nugs are dense, with a light green appearance, orange hairs, and a think layer of potent trichome crystals. Adverse effects aren't widely reported, but cottonmouth is usually the most common when using marijuana, along with dry eyes and paranoia.

Giga Bud Strain,"Giga Bud is an indica dominant hybrid with a 60:40 indica/sativa ratio.

The nuggets are large but compact and are dark green in color, all the while being covered by a thick coating of fat resin. As for the aroma, it smells like freshly cut apricots with hash undertones. However, the scent is not as pungent or overpowering as it is supposed to be. On the other hand, the Giga Bud tastes exceptionally good and offers a perfect blend of spicy and sweet with a hint of fruity flavors that should keep any cannabis user coming back for more. One of the best things about the Giga Bud is that its effects are long-lasting and strong at the same time. A hit or two is more than enough before you start exhibiting symptoms of couch-lock. The strain has mood-elevating effects and is perfect for individuals who are finding it extremely difficult dealing with anxiety and mood disorders. On the other hand, the strain does have numbing effects that should also allow individuals to treat chronic pains and aches as well. The medical applications of the strain are many as it has also been used to treat several other problems like depression and stress."
Girl Scout Cookies #2 Strain,"A close relative of the original Girl Scout Cookies, this prized and potent strain packs THC levels topping 24 percent. It's grown only in Washington State, and that's about the only place it can be bought. It's very popular among the patients who have used it, as it washes away stress and anxiety, leaving a calm, soothed state that lasts for hours. It's not clear how much of this strain is sativa and how much is indica, but it's an indica-dominant hybrid, so the body effects are more pronounced. Girl Scout Cookies #2 has a sweet flavor and smells exactly as its name implies: like Girl Scout cookies. The high brings both bodily relaxation and mental clarity. This strain is most effective at treating anxiety, insomnia, and stress, but it's also very good for chronic pain. The strain's parentage is a little unclear. It's a descendant of the original Girl Scout Cookies, also an indica-dominant hybrid, but it's uncertain whether that strain was inbred or crossed with another strain. The strength of this marijuana alone recommends it as a stress reliever, and the taste and aroma don't hurt."
Gnarsty Strain,"Gnarsty is a sativa dominant hybrid (80% sativa/20% indica) strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and controversy surrounding its origins. This dank bud boasts an insanely high THC level ranging from 18-26% on average and a myriad of both indica and sativa effects. Users describe the Gnarsty high as having an almost immediate onset of a very clear-headed and motivated euphoric head high.

GodCrack Strain,"Green Crack and God Bud were crossed to create GodCrack, a potent near-even hybrid with a sativa/indica ratio of roughly 45:55. There isn't much available information about this well-liked but rare medical choice. The nugs are reportedly quite large, with a layer of trichomes, but beyond that little is known about its appearance, aroma, or flavor. Based on GodCrack's parentage, though, users can expect a sweet, fruity taste and a pungent, earthy smell. This strain isn't terribly popular, but it's also new, and it may just be a matter of time before it catches on. It's already known for its potency, though exact THC levels are hard to come by. But it definitely isn't known for its CBD contents, so it probably shouldn't be used as the sole treatment for seizures or other disorders that respond to CBD. Instead, use GodCrack to treat anxiety, insomnia, inflammation, and lack of appetite; this strain produces a powerful case of the munchies. The high, which leans slightly toward the indica side, is deeply relaxing, both mentally and physically, yet isn't overpowering for most patients. GodCrack is sold in California, but elsewhere it's still a rarity."

Additionally, they mostly have a good amount of crystal coverage as well. The smell is unique and offers an amazing blend of spice and fruity scents with kush undertones. The first hit will taste like kush but after some time you will notice a delicious blueberry taste. Two to three hits are more than enough before that smooth and easy feeling sets in. However, a few more hits after that will knock you out if you are not careful. But then again, you will feel relaxed due to the body numbing effects of the strain. On the other hand, experienced users mostly feel energized by its effects and may feel creative at the same time. TV will never seem more appealing and music will not sound as good as it will after smoking Golden Jamaican Kush.

The strain is strong to say the least. Gracie Slick can be used during the day or the night and its effects vary depending on consumption. The strain is better known for its medicinal effects and offers a heady high instead of knocking you out for good. However, a few more hits are more than enough to make you feel sleepy and exhibit symptoms of couch-lock. Gracie Slick is perfect for individuals who wish to socialize without being in a haze.

The effects of Phoenix Sun are energized and euphoric, with mental clarity and happiness. It can be used to treat multiple health problems, such as anxiety, depression, mood disorders, fatigue, nausea, stress, and insomnia. Details on negative effects is limited, but cottonmouth and dry eyes are probably common. Obviously the best place to look for Phoenix Sun is on Arizona's medical market, but it doesn't appear to be popular anywhere else."
Perplex Strain,"Grapefruit is the dominant taste and aroma in this THC-heavy, sativa-dominant hybrid (exact sativa/indica ratio unclear) known for its powerful high. Exact numbers on THC levels are hard to come by, and the available tests suggest a THC level around 15%. But that may reflect the paucity of information rather than the true potency of this strain. The same goes for CBD levels, though most high-THC strains are low in CBD, so this isn't recommended for epileptics and others who benefit from CBD. Instead, it's recommended as a treatment for cramps, chronic body pain, inflammation, anxiety, and stress. The high is heavily cerebral, creating a creative, clear-headed state with energy, strong euphoria, and improved mood. Expect typical side effects, including cottonmouth and red eyes, though there isn't much information on this front, either. In addition to grapefruit, this strain tastes and smells of grape and other fruits. Perplex nugs are blanketed in resin-rich trichomes, a hint at the effects that await. This strain doesn't come around very often, though it might be possible to find it in Colorado. Otherwise, don't put yourself out; despite its potency, it's rare almost everywhere."
Pineapple G-13 Strain,"Pineapple G-13, also known more commonly as “Pineapple Express,” is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid (60% sativa/40% indica) strain created through a cross of the powerful"
Platinum Ghost Strain,"This indica-heavy hybrid (sativa/indica ratio unclear) delivers a strong, distinct odor and flavor of berries and hash plant. The nugs are dark green with brown hairs and a layer of trichome crystals. Platinum Ghost is said to deliver a potent and immediate high that hits both the body and the mind. The effects are calming but energized, with couch-lock effects, euphoria, and sharp mental focus. This strain can be a useful medicine for the treatment of anxiety, low mood, chronic pain, stress, and sleeplessness. The potency of Platinum Ghost is hard to gauge, as there are few public test results available. But its reputation suggests it's relatively strong, if not remarkably so. The same lack of information on CBD levels mean patients shouldn't rely on this strain as their only treatment for conditions that require CBD concentrates, such as severe epilepsy. Reports of side effects are few and far between, but users can probably expect dry mouth and red eyes, as well as possible paranoia. Platinum Ghost can be purchased in Southern California and Colorado, but it isn't common even in those places."
Platinum Godberry Strain,"Platinum Godberry, also known more commonly as “Godbud,” is an indica dominant hybrid strain created through a cross of the powerful"
Presidential Bubba Strain,"Presidential Bubba, also known as ""Presidential OG"" to many users, is a 100% pure indica strain that is an insane cross of the hugely popular"
Purple Pine Strain,"Purple Pine may simply be another name for Purple Pine Cone, but there isn't enough information available about either strain to know for sure. In any event, this strain is an indica-dominant hybrid with an unknown ratio of sativa to indica. The few available tests suggest THC levels are rather low, below 10%. Unfortunately, CBD is also low, limiting the medical usefulness of Purple Pine. It's recommended for use in treating anxiety, but that's about it. Because of the low CBD content, this strain shouldn't be used to treat seizure disorders or other health conditions that can be alleviated with that cannabinoid. The physical high, both happy and sleepy, is a result of this strain's indica-heavy genes. The flavor and smell of Purple Pine are harsh with sweet notes of berry. The buds are purple with long orange hairs. Side effects aren't widely reported, but they probably include dry eyes and dry mouth, as well as possible paranoia or anxiety. This strain is a Washington State specialty, but it can also be found on the medical marijuana market in Southern California."
Platinum King Kush Strain,"The Platinum King Kush is bright green in color with crystals covering the buds, which make it look platinum. Orange hairs grow from this leafy strain of marijuana. Smoking the Platinum King Kush gives users a body and head buzz due to THC and CBD levels. It is indica-dominant therefore, it calms down the nerves of the user and makes them feel relaxed and stress-free. Mostly, effects are cerebral and increase the release of endorphins, which elevates and uplifts spirits. Platinum King Kush is also known to cause drowsiness and induce sleep. Platinum King Kush is used as medical marijuana to treat psychological disorders of anxiety and depression. It also reduces inflammation and cures mild headaches or migraines. This strain is effective for all kinds of physical and mental pain and is also used by insomniacs to get a good night's sleep. The strain has an earthy flavor with bursts of citrus that tantalize the taste buds of smokers with every toke. The smoke emits an aroma, which is pungent and dank but also pleasing to the nose as it has an earthy and citrusy complexity added to it as well. The THC content is at 18% while CBD makes up 0.24% of the drug."
Pure Gold Strain,"Pure Gold is an indica-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio unknown), though it may also come in a sativa-dominant variety. It's hard to say for sure, as this modestly potent strain is rather obscure, possibly found in California but not much of anywhere else. It's unclear how much of the plant is THC and how much is CBD, but the few scattered reports on Pure Gold suggest it isn't particularly heavy with either. The lack of CBD means this strain shouldn't be used as the only tool for treating seizure disorders or other conditions that can be relieved with that chemical. Rather, Pure Gold can be used to medicate anxiety, lack of appetite, and sleeplessness. The high is physical, inducing deep relaxation, sleepiness, and couch-lock effects. This strain produces bright green buds with orange hairs and trichomes. The smell is Skunky with hints of lemon, while the flavor includes notes of lemon, vanilla, and wood. There are few public reports of adverse effects caused by Pure Gold, but it's safe to assume dry mouth, red eyes, and paranoia are among them. Found throughout California, this strain is relatively popular on the legal market, less so on the black market."
Purple Butter Strain,"This indica strain (exact sativa/indica ratio unknown) is known to deliver a very potent body high perfect for late nights and rainy days. It also spurs a powerful case of the munchies, making Purple Butter an ideal choice for patients with eating disorders or wasting conditions. It's also recommended for treatment of headaches and chronic pain. The effects are almost entirely physical and deeply sedating, so this strain shouldn't be used on busy days or when mental focus is needed. It's hard to discern how much THC this strain contains, as tests aren't widely reported. The same is true of CBD, and that alone suggests Purple Butter shouldn't be used as the only treatment for CBD-friendly diseases, such as epilepsy. There are no reliable public reports on the side effects patients may experience when using this strain, but most other strains produce dry eyes and dry mouth. Purple Butter has a distinct berry flavor, with smooth grape notes; the aroma is similar but with additional hints of Skunk. This strain sells in San Diego but appears to be very rare almost everywhere else."
Purple Dynamite Strain,"There are no public reports on the exact genetic balance of Purple Dynamite, but if its parents are any indication, it's a near-pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100). This strain was the result of a cross between Purple Kush and Dynamite, both pure indicas. The THC levels in Purple Dynamite top out at more than 22% in available tests, making this an excellent and powerful choice for treating anxiety, depression, eating disorders, wasting disorders, and physical pain. The effects are physical and deeply calming, with couch-lock effects and powerful hunger. CBD levels are minimal, however, which means Purple Dynamite is not a good medication for the treatment of epilepsy or other conditions that respond to CBD. With a sweet, tropical flavor, this strain smells of berries. It has dense, dark purple buds with a heavy frosting of resinous crystals. Patients and recreational users of this strain have reported few side effects, but they likely include watery eyes, dry mouth, and possibly paranoia. Despite its potency, Purple Dynamite isn't especially popular anywhere, though it can be found on the medical marijuana market in Massachusetts and possibly elsewhere."
Purple Emergency Strain,"This rare medical strain has THC levels that exceed 19% in some samples, making it a particularly potent choice for treating a range of health problems, including anxiety, low mood, chronic pain, and everyday stresses. Purple Emergency is said to be an indica-dominant hybrid, but the exact ratio of sativa to indica is hard to determine. The effects are mostly physical, with deep body relaxation and pain relief. This strain isn't recommended as primary treatment for conditions that require CBD extracts, including childhood seizure disorders, as the levels of that chemical are very low, less than 1%. As its name suggests, Purple Emergency has dark purple buds with a healthy layer of crystals. The aroma and flavor of this strain are sweet and smooth. With little available data on the subject, it's hard to say what the most common side effects of Purple Emergency are, but dry mouth and red eyes are usually a good bet when using any strain of marijuana. This strain can be found in the South Bay Area in California, but it doesn't have much of a fan base elsewhere."
Purple Express Strain,"Purple Express is a 10% pure-indica hybrid strain, but its specific history is unclear. The same is true of nearly every detail about this decidedly rare medical option. With pure indica parentage, this strain likely delivers an intensely physical high that is great for relaxation, pain relief, and anxiety. Like other indicas, it's typically best used late at night or on days with few activities, as it probably can generate significant couch-lock and sedative effects. Nobody seems to know which strains were combined to create Purple Express, but the name suggests a connection to Pineapple Express, a popular hybrid. The ""Purple"" heredity could refer to the strain's purple coloring or to any of a number of ""Purps"" parents descended from the original Mendocino Purps. A grape-like aroma and flavor are likely, though there are few reports on taste, smell, or appearance. Reports on adverse effects are likewise very hard to come by, but patients should expect the usual: dry mouth, red eyes, and paranoia. Purple Express may be found in Amsterdam, but it's far from common in other parts of the world."
Purple Fire Strain,"This hybrid's name is well deserved, for after firing up on it, you will experience a beautiful high. To begin, the appearance is beautiful, featuring large amounts of reddish hairs against a purpled / red colored bud, which are slathered with crystals. There are a moderate amount of leaves, which are bright green. It has a medium amount of aroma, which is close to a sniff at the produce isle. The taste is like that of a grape which has been fermented in spices. The buzz is a body and head combination, which will leave you full of energy and wanting to get creative. Medicinally, it is used as a pain reliever, and to treat depression, and paranoia. The side effects after smoking this are nice, the body buzz giving you a smooth feeling, as well as taking care of minor pains, and then you get a hit of sleepiness. All in all this is a nice, full bodied balanced weed."
Purple Goblin Strain,"This indica-dominant hybrid (ratio of sativa/indica is unknown) is the offspring of Mendocino Purps (aka Purps) and Green Goblin (aka Green Crack), both strong, popular strains. It's unclear how much of that potency carries down to Purple Goblin, as THC contents aren't widely known. The same goes with CBD, the chemical often used to treat seizure disorders and some other conditions, though it's probably safe to assume it's not terribly high. As its genes suggest, Purple Goblin is a body-centered strain, with a deeply calming body high and limited cerebral buzz. Beyond that, there's little available information on the precise effects, or even on what conditions this strain is best for. But indicas are generally best at relieving physical pain, alleviating anxiety, and protecting against depression. This strain has a berry aroma and most likely a similar flavor. The bud is dark green and purple, with a hairy coat of trichomes on the surface. There are few reports of adverse effects from smoking Purple Goblin, but dry mouth and red eyes are always possible, as is paranoia. This strain definitely isn't easy to find, but it might be found in the American West."
Purple Jack Strain,"This combination of two perennial favorites – Purple Kush and Jack Herer – is a sativa-dominant hybrid, though the exact balance of sativa to indica is something of a mystery. But Purple Jack likely has a fair amount of both gene types, since Purple Kush is a heavy indica and Jack Herer a heavy sativa. THC levels are low in this strain, regularly testing at below 10%. It's harder to come by reliable data on CBD levels, however, so Purple Jack probably shouldn't be used as the only means of treating seizures or other conditions that respond to that cannabinoid. But it's ideal for patients who want a relaxing but energizing cerebral alternative to more potent choices. Though dominated by sativa genes, Purple Jack also produces physical effects, including couch-lock. It's likely a good choice for anxiety and irritability, but otherwise medical uses aren't widely reported. This strain has a musky, spicy aroma with hints of Skunk, while the flavor is smooth and musky with notes of hash and pine. The nugs are dark and lime green, with a fluffy appearance, purple leaves, and a light dusting of trichomes."
Purple M&M Strain,"THC levels vary in this cross of M&M Pure Kush and Purple Urkle, but available tests suggest they hover around 13%. That makes this a relatively modest choice for conditions that require THC. The presence of CBD, meanwhile, is very limited, less than 0.2%. That means this strain is best for treating THC-related conditions than disorders that respond to CBD, such as epilepsy. The indica genes are dominant in Purple M&M, though not by much. The exact ratio of sativa to indica is unknown. The high is body-focused, with a calming, sleepy sensation. But there are also psychoactive cerebral effects stemming from this strain's sativa heritage. Purple M&M can be used to relieve anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. It has a smooth pine flavor and a skunky aroma. The buds have a speckled, leafy green-and-brown appearance with few trichomes. Adverse effects likely include dry mouth and red eyes, though there are few reports along these lines. This strain definitely isn't widely available. It might be found on the West Coast, though even there it's scarce. Though not especially popular among patients, this strain can be very useful in relieving the stresses of everyday life."
Purple Maroc Strain,"This pure sativa strain (sativa/indica ratio of 100:0) comes from the Ketama region of Morocco, though its exact origins remain something of a mystery. It has relatively high THC levels, which exceed 16% in available tests. That makes Purple Maroc a very effective choice for treating anxiety and depression, though the full medical uses of this strain are hard to determine. The effects are mostly happy, a cerebral result of the sativa-dominant genes. But with very low CBD concentrations, less than 1%, this shouldn't be a first choice for treating problems that are relieved with that cannabinoid. That includes severe pediatric seizure disorders. Purple Maroc produces a sweet, fruity aroma and a sweet and sour flavor. As its name suggests, the buds and leaves of this strain have dark purple hues. Since side effect reports are scarce, it's hard to say which are the most likely, but dry mouth and red eyes are usually common. Presumably Purple Maroc can be found in Morocco and possibly Europe, but it's definitely uncommon in the United States, on or off the legal medical marijuana markets."
Rhino Diesel Strain,"Rhine Diesel, also known by its genetics to many members of the cannabis community, is an indica dominant hybrid (70% indica/30% sativa) strain that is a potent cross of the insanely popular"
Purple NYC Strain,"This hybrid strain is a specialized treat, hard to find but worth trying at least once. The THC levels are moderate, though the actual numbers are unclear. Purple NYC Diesel provides a relaxing physical high great for melting away stress and body aches. This strain has the genes of Sour Diesel and Mendocino Purps (aka ""The Purps""), but beyond that it's unknown what plants were involved in the breeding process. It's indica-dominant but, again, the exact proportion of sativa to indica is hard to come by. Mostly this is because Purple NYC Diesel is something of a regional specialty, uncommon outside New York and the West Coast. It can be bought at some California dispensaries, but otherwise it's rarely offered on the legal market. This strain can be an effective treatment for insomnia and anxiety, as well as chronic pain and lack of appetite. Purple NYC Diesel has a light citrus aroma and a faint chemical taste from its Diesel origins. It's not a great strain for getting things done during the day, but it can hit the spot late at night."
Purple Snow Strain,"Purple Snow, also known as ""Snowcap Purple"" to many members of the cannabis community, is a sativa dominant hybrid (80% sativa/20% indica) strain that is a dank cross of the insanely popular"
Queen Green Strain,"Queen Green is a strong marijuana strain that has a mushy green appearance. It is a cross between Green Crack and Space Queen, hence the name Queen Green. It has a very high THC level and an extremely powerful buzz that takes over your entire body immediately. It has a very interesting and pungent flavor, which has a good combination of nutty and spicy tastes. It also has that hint of earthy flavor that produces a nice, soothing effect on the body. Queen Green's aroma is a very nice as well. Its aroma is a blend of earthy, nutty, spicy and herbal odors. Queen Green mostly has positive effects on your body. It makes you feel extremely euphoric and happy as soon as you smoke it. It also energizes and makes you feel creative. Therefore, it is good for when you want to work on something that requires creativity. This marijuana strain is used for treating a number of conditions. It is excellent for curing anxiety, stress and depression, which is why anxiety patients often rely on Queen Green for mitigating their stress. It can also be used for soothing high blood pressure and can provide relief from terrible mood swings. Irregular and hard bowel movements can also be treated with Queen Green. You can also use it for nausea, insomnia and pain."
Rock Candy Strain,"Rock Candy, also known as ""Alien Rock Candy"" to most of the cannabis community, is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain created by Alien Genetics as a cross between the hugely popular"
Romulan Cotton Candy Strain,"This indica-dominant medical strain is hard to find, and its lack of potency may be one reason why. THC levels can top 15%, but that doesn't put this strain on the top shelf. Meanwhile, CBD numbers are decidedly low, with that chemical making up less than 0.3% of this strain. Not surprisingly, Romulan Cotton Candy is a cross between Romulan, a popular indica, and Cotton Candy, a sativa-dominant hybrid. The exact ratio of sativa to indica in this strain is unknown. But the indica genes create a calming body effect complemented by a clear-headed cerebral high provided by the sativa genes. The experience is spacey but energized. Best for treating anxiety, headaches, and nausea, Romulan Cotton Candy is also helpful with chronic pain and lack of appetite, as it creates a strong case of the munchies. This strain has a definite cotton candy aroma with notes of fruit, while it tastes of sweet candy and pepper. Aside from hunger, potential adverse effects include cottonmouth and dry eyes. Romulan Cotton Candy isn't particularly popular anywhere, though it can probably be found in some Colorado dispensaries."
Runuponyah Strain,Runuponyah is a heavily indica dominant hybrid (90% indica/10% sativa) strain famous among a small following of medical marijuana users that is a potent cross between the insanely popular
J's Famous Kush Strain,"J’s Famous Kush is a sativa dominant hybrid strain created through a three-way cross of unknown Northern California hybrids. Although the exact parentage of this bud is kept under close wraps by its breeders, J’s Famous Kush is a patient favorite for its spasticity-taming effects and its powerful THC level of up to 21%. J’s Famous Kush packs a clear-headed high that’s great for the daytime and should be avoided by any users who suffer from anxiety. The high starts with a subtle lift that leaves you uplifted and happy with a sense of laser-sharp focus, helping you tackle whatever task comes your way. As this cerebral high builds, a slight body high will overcome you, erasing any aches and pains and replacing them with pangs of hunger. Because of its effects, J’s Famous Kush is the perfect choice for treating conditions such as appetite loss, spasticity, chronic stress, and chronic fatigue. This bud has a classic flavor any connoisseur will love, with an earthy taste that’s accented by sweet herbs and peppery skunk. The aroma is very pungent with an earthy skunky overtone accented by spicy pepper and sweet herbs. J’s Famous Kush buds have piecey and flat forest green nugs with rich amber undertones and hairs and a thick frosty coating of amber colored crystal trichomes."
Aurora Berry-allis Strain,Aurora Berry-allis is a rare indica dominant hybrid strain created through crossing the classic
Palouse Peach Strain,"Palouse Peach is a sativa dominant hybrid strain with unknown parentage due to a high level of breeder secrecy about its parentage. Even with little known about its background, Palouse Peach is one tasty bud that’s infamous for its insanely delicious flavor that’s just like a freshly picked sugary sweet peach! The smell is just as nice, with a sweet peachy flavor with a tangy spice that’s released as the nugs are broken apart and burned. Palouse Peach buds have dense light minty green spade-shaped nugs with bright orange hairs and a super thick frosty coating of tiny crystal trichomes that are vibrantly bright. The Palouse Peach high is just as addicting as its flavor with uplifted powerful effects that are euphoric and relaxing in nature, perfect for kicking back during a lazy afternoon indoors or outdoors. The high starts with an uplifted effect that leaves you feeling happy with a sense of creative energy. You’ll be focused and feel artistically inspired as your mind and mood soar through the clouds. With these effects and its powerful THC level that typically hits about 19-26% on average, Palouse Peach is said to be perfect for treating a variety of conditions including chronic stress, depression, inattentiveness, and mood swings."

Gigabud Strain,"Gigabud is an indica dominant hybrid (60% indica/40% sativa) strain famous among the cannabis community for its insanely oversized nugs. Although the exact genetics of this strain are unknown, many users believe that it is a cross between the hugely popular"
Chronic Tonic Strain,"Chronic Tonic, not to be confused with the popular THC-infused drink, is a super rare evenly balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain with unknown parentage. This bud is so rare, in fact, that it is typically only available on a private reserve level at a few dispensaries on the West Coast. Nonetheless, you’ll want to get your hands on this premium bud after you experience it’s sweet flavor and powerful effects. Chronic Tonic is said to have a sweet and spicy herbal flavor with a touch of lime on each exhale. The smell is very earthy and herbal with a citrus pine overtone that’s almost like PineSol cleaner. The high comes on pretty quickly after you first experience the sweet flavor, lifting your spirits and infusing you with a hazy sense of happiness. Your mind will ebb in and out of spacey introspection as your body falls off into a warming slightly numbing body high. Oftentimes this body high will be the tipping point of your stoniness, dropping you off into a sleepy sedated state. Thanks to these effects and its high THC level, Chronic Tonic is the perfect choice for treating insomnia, depression, chronic fatigue, and chronic pain. This bud has small spade-shaped yellow green nugs with bright orange hairs and a coating of golden crystal trichomes."
Red Lion Keif Strain,"Red Lion Kief, also known simply as “Red Lion,” is a heavily sativa dominant hybrid (90% sativa/10% indica) strain created as a kief infused variety of the infamous Sour Diesel. With a super high 28% minimum THC level and CBD levels that typically top 2%, Red Lion Kief is one hell of a ride. The high hits you first with an energetic boost that lifts your mood and infuses you with a sense of motivation. As this feeling grows, you’ll start to feel creatively inspired with a slight hint of focus that’s not enough to make you anxious, although it can affect some users. With these high-powered effects, Red Lion Kief is recommended for experienced users who suffer from conditions such as chronic pain, nausea, appetite loss, depression, and chronic stress. This bud has a super dank flavor accented by sweet kush and earth and a pungent grassy aroma to match, although it does take a sweet candy-infused musky turn upon burning. Red Lion Kief buds have dense spade-shaped light minty green nugs with light amber hairs and a thick frosty coating of light green kief and sparkling clear crystals."

GRiZ Kush Strain,GRIZ Kush is a sativa dominant hybrid strain created through a cross of the classic
LVPK Strain,"One of the quality Indica strains available is called LVPK. It is a hybrid of Hindu Kush and Purple Afghani. The THC is about 18% and you don't need very much of it to get a high. The high is almost instant. While it has a skunky smell, it has a floral sweet taste. LVPK is very dark green in color. As it gets closer and closer to time for harvesting, orange and purple hairs will emerge. By the time this cannabis is harvested, those hairs will be blood red/orange and a deep purple/blue. The yield of crystals on the leaves is very high. Many users like LVPK because it helps to stimulate the mind. It helps with focus and improves creativity. It can make the body tingly, especially in the fingers and toes. It is common to get the munchies with this form of cannabis so it is a good option for those with eating disorders where they need to eat more."
Puffin Purple Strain,"Puffin Purple is a 100% pure indica hybrid strain that is a resurrection of the infamous Canadian Purple strain created and exclusively sold by the renowned Puffin Farms. Although it’s parentage is relatively unknown, Puffin Purple is a rare user favorite of the Purple family. Puffin Purple has a sweet musky aroma with hints of dank grape and berry accented by pungent fruitiness and a touch of earth. The taste is just amazing with a fruity grapey flavor that sweetens upon exhale with a hint of pungency that tickles your tongue. The Puffin Purple high is super stoney in nature with surprisingly cerebral effects that leave you distant and spacey for hours on end. It starts with a slowly creeping head buzz that leaves you with a heavy head and eyes and psychoactive effects that send your mind soaring. As this high builds, it will slowly spread throughout the rest of your body, numbing your pains and leaving you feel completely relaxed and blissfully happy. Because of these powerful effects and its high 14-15% average THC level, Puffin Purple is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as migraines or headaches, chronic anxiety or stress, and insomnia.

Sagamatha Blueberry Strain,"Sagamatha Blueberry, also known as ""Sagamatha Blueberry Bud"" to many members of the cannabis community, was created by the infamous DJ Short at the Sagamatha Seeds farms as a Blueberry phenotype that was isolated and back-bred. This dank bud is a 100% pure indica strain that boasts a high average THC level ranging from 22-24%. Sagamatha Blueberry buds have round thick bright neon green dense nugs that have rich amber undertones and a spattering of bright fiery orange hairs. These nugs are covered with minty green leaves and a caked on layer of thick crystal white trichomes. This strain has a delicious taste of sweet blueberry with a hint of vanilla that intensifies upon exhale and an aroma of tasty blueberry tarts. Users describe the Sagarmatha Blueberry high as one that provides an immediate long-lasting uplifted sense of euphoria and mind relief. This head high is powerful and potent but not too overwhelming. This is accompanied by a moderate warming body buzz that isn't sedative but leaves you utterly relaxed and at ease. Due to these potent indica effects, Sagarmatha Blueberry is an ideal strain for treating depression, chronic stress or anxiety, and chronic pain due to injury or illness."
Sensativa Strain,"Sensativa is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid (60% sativa/40% indica) strain that has unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and a THC level ranging from 14-17% on average. Sensativa users describe the high as one that has a slowly building onset of an uplifting and motivating cerebral head high. This head high peaks and then slowly falls into a sedative warming body buzz that leaves you calm, relaxed, and completely couch-locked. As this sativa body high continues, a sense of the munchies will build and peak, leaving you desperate for food just before you fall into a state of deep sedation. Due to these potent sativa and indica effects, Sensativa is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as appetite loss, chronic pain due to injury or illness, muscle spasms, and sleep disorders, including insomnia. Sensativa buds have dense leafy spade-shaped dark olive green nugs with patches of light minty green and a sparse layering of dark red furry hairs. These nugs are dusted with a fine layer of milky white trichomes and are dripping with sweet sticky resin. This strain has a taste of sweet fruity citrus with an incredibly smooth exhale and an aroma of sweet hashy fruit."
Shiva X Strain,"This potent indica-heavy hybrid (sativa/indica ratio unknown) gets both its name and its most potent genes from Shiva, itself a potent indica named after Shiva the Destroyer, a Hindu God who has the power to both give and take life. Shiva was mixed with an unknown sativa to create Shiva X, which originally went by the name Chuck Norris due to its serious kick. This strain is nothing if not powerful and should be avoided by newcomers. Exact THC numbers are scarce, but likely top 20%. CBD levels are an even greater mystery, but if anything, that recommends against using Shiva X as exclusive treatment for epilepsy or other conditions treated with CBD. This strain hits hard and fast, creating a potent head rush followed by strong euphoria. The experience blends sativa and indica genetics, hitting both the head and body. Side effects are possible, including increased heart rate in the first few minutes after smoking, cottonmouth, and dry eyes. Paranoia is also reported. The exact medical properties of Shiva X are generally unknown, though it may help with anxiety and mood issues. The strain has a fruity smell and taste, and it has a light green appearance with orange hairs and a layer of trichomes."
Shoreline Strain,"Shoreline is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain created by breeders at the infamous Sensi Seeds farms as an older phenotype of Sensi Skunk. This strain first appeared in the 1980's as an ""old school skunk"" and gets its name from the Shoreline Amphitheater, where the Grateful Dead had a monumentally successful concert debut. This dank bud boasts a moderate THC level ranging from 18-23% on average and a myriad of potent indica and sativa effects. Users describe the Shoreline high as one that leaves you intensely euphoric and uplifted with a sense of social encouragement and creative inspiration. This is accompanied by a mild warming body buzz that provides significant pain relief and leaves you grounded and relaxed with a mild sense of spaciness. Due to these potent indica and sativa effects, Shoreline is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress and anxiety, nausea, and appetite loss. Shoreline has an aroma of sweet earthy skunk and a taste of sweet earthy citrus with a hint of skunk. Shoreline buds have long dense leafy spade-shaped nugs that are minty green with dark olive green undertones and long, thin orange hairs."

Silver Tip Strain,"Silver Tip, also known as ""Montana Silvertip"" to many members of the cannabis community, is a sativa dominant hybrid (60% sativa/40% indica) strain that is an extremely potent cross between the insanely popular"
Sleestack X Skunk Strain,"You won't find this rare crossbreed in many legal dispensaries, but it's a common source of hashish and cannabis resin products. Sometimes known as SleeSkunk, this strain blends the well-known genetics of Afghan Skunk, an indica, and the much more obscure heredity of Sleestack, itself a rare hybrid of uncertain genetic balance. The end result has a sativa/indica ratio of 70:30, making for strong heady effects. Not much else is widely known about the high this strain produces, however. That also goes for the concentrations of THC and CBD in Sleestack X Skunk. But given its popularity as a hash plant, this strain is presumably quite potent with THC. The lack of data on CBD, on the other hand, recommends against using it as a sole treatment for seizures or other conditions that are treated with CBD. Aside from anxiety, it's not clear what conditions respond best to this medial choice. Smoking this as dried marijuana will likely produce typical side effects, including cottonmouth and bloodshot eyes. Smoking it in the form of hash could lead to somewhat different effects."
Smelly Guy Strain,"Smelly Guy is a 100% pure indica hybrid strain that has unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and a moderately high THC level ranging from 19-21% on average. Although its exact parentage is unknown, many members of the cannabis community agree that it is likely a cross of"
Sloppy Bowl Strain,"Sloppy bowl is a 100% pure indica hybrid strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and a moderate THC level ranging from 14-19% on average. Sloppy Bowl users describe the high as one that has an almost immediate onset of a calming yet giggly social head high that leaves you activated and aroused yet somehow completely relaxed. This head high is ideal for social situations, as you'll be talkative yet utterly at ease. This cerebral high is accompanied by a relaxing mellow body stone that leaves you spacey but comfortable with a pretty intense case of the munchies. Due to these potent indica effects, Sloppy Bowl is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as mild to moderate cases of depression, chronic stress or anxiety, and mood swings. Sloppy Bowl has a potent aroma of harsh minty pine and a taste that is equally as harsh with minty pine and a hint of spice upon exhale. Sloppy Bowl buds have super fluffy minty green popcorn-shaped nugs that are almost completely covered with tiny dark olive green leaves. These nugs also have dark green undertones and a spattering of many long thin almost translucent amber hairs and a fine layer of milky white trichomes and resin."
Sour Romulan Strain,"Sour Romulan is an Indica dominant strain that sits at 80% Indica and 20% Sativa. The high is very soothing and strong - typical of Indica, but with the addition of focus and attention. Very cerebral effects are king with euphoric and delicate muscle relaxation mixed right in. The spacey type of state is reported to last for around three hours, and there are no troublesome lingering side effects to deal with. Patients who medicate with this strain say that is great for relaxing in general, depression, anxiety, good for pain relief, good for OCD, useful as a muscle relaxant, and very helpful with stress. The appearance of this strain is beautiful in an alien sort of way - full of bright oranges, mixes of violets and reds, deep purples, and neon greens. The aroma in the beginning is similar to a grape-flavored sour candy mixed with musty earth. The taste on the inhale is musky grape, and earthy on the exhale."
Snow Wreck Strain,Snow Wreck is a sativa dominant hybrid (80% sativa/20% indica) strain that is a potent cross between the hugely popular
Sorry Sucker Strain,"Sorry Sucker is a rare hybrid mix of indica and sativa, though it isn't widely known which is dominant, let alone the exact ratio. The same is true of the amount of THC and CBD in this strain, though that alone means it's safe to assume CBD content is very low, too low for use in treating seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to the chemical. Sorry Sucker is said to be a somewhat potent daytime strain, but not notably so. The high mixes sativa and indica effects but leans toward cerebral, with an energized shot of euphoria. It's a good way to treat anxiety, depression, nerve pain, and chronic pain. It's an especially effective medication for multiple sclerosis, tremors, and mood disorders. The smell is floral and sweet, while the flavor has fruity hints of cherry and ice cream. The appearance is light green with golden yellow hairs on the bud. Reports of adverse effects are few and far between, but it's usually a safe bet to expect dry mouth, red eyes, and possibly paranoia. Sorry Sucker might be found in dispensaries on the West Coast, but probably not."
Snoop's Master Kush Strain,"Snoop's Master Kush, also known as ""Snoop's Dream"" to many members of the cannabis community, is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain that is a potent cross between the insanely popular"
Sour Russian Strain,Sour Russian is an indica dominant hybrid (70% indica/30% sativa) strain created by breeders at the infamous DNA Genetics farms as a potent cross between the hugely popular
Sour Cherry Strain,"Though its name suggests a blend of Sour Diesel and Cherry Pie, in fact Sour Cherry descends from Sage 'N' Sour OG and Buddha's Sister, both Dutch hybrids. The smell is unique and not entirely pleasant, with strong notes of cherry and rotten fruit. This strain tastes of cherry, lemon, lime, and menthol, as well as sour notes of whiskey. Sour Cherry is a sativa/indica hybrid with an unknown ratio of sativa to indica, though the effects lean toward indica. There's no publicly available data on THC levels in this strain, and the same goes for CBD contents, but the lack of information on CBD alone suggests Sour Cherry isn't a great choice for patients who need that chemical to treat seizures or other conditions. The THC, however much there may be, produces a strong, calming body buzz that's ideal for relieving the symptoms of low mood, chronic physical pain, and sleepless nights. Reports on adverse effects are hard to come by, but users can expect red eyes and dry mouth, as well as possible paranoia and dizziness. Sour Cherry can be found in a handful of dispensaries in Oregon but isn't popular much of anywhere."
Spawntanica Strain,"Spawntanica is a heavily indica dominant hybrid (90% indica/10% sativa) strain created by breeders at the infamous Spawntanica Seeds farms. This dank bud has unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and boats a THC level ranging from 15-19% on average. Spawntanica users describe the high as having an almost immediate onset of a mildly uplifting cerebral head high that is accompanied by a warming body buzz that slowly spreads from the upper head and back of the neck throughout the rest of the body. This provides calming mind relief as well as significant sedative relaxation and body relief. Due to these potent effects, Spawntanica is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as insomnia and other sleeping disorders, chronic stress and anxiety, and appetite loss. Spawntanica has an aroma of crisp fresh pine with a hint of earth and a taste of fresh lemony pine that sweetens upon exhale. The Spawntanica buds have dark olive green spade-shaped nugs that are insanely dense and leafy. These nugs are spattered with a thin layer of almost translucent short amber hairs and are caked with a thick layer of frosty huge, oversized white crystal trichomes and sweet sticky resin."
Sour Pineapple Strain,"Sour Pineapple merges the genetics of two beloved, sativa-dominant strains, Sour Diesel and Pineapple Kush. Sour Pineapple is a sativa-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of roughly 70:30) that is known to be an effective treatment for anxiety, everyday stress, and nausea. The sativa genes make for a decidedly cerebral high, with clear-headed thinking and a strong boost of energy. THC levels are between 13% and 18% in available tests, making this a mid-shelf strain in terms of potency. CBD contents are harder to come by, but that alone means Sour Pineapple shouldn't be used as the sole treatment for conditions that respond to this cannabinoid, especially seizure disorders. Sour Pineapple has a pungent, Skunky aroma and a dank, pungent flavor. The bud is multi-colored, with dark green leaves, amber hairs, and a modest dusting of trichomes. There are few public reports of adverse effects, but dry mouth and red eyes are common in most cannabis strains. This strain is found mostly on the medical marijuana markets of Washington State and Oregon, but it's not especially popular anywhere in the United States."
Spurkle Strain,"Spurkle's genes definitely lean in the direction of its very popular indica-dominant parents, G13 and Purple Kush. The sativa/indica ratio in this strain is 60:40, and that makes for a long lasting high featuring a calming body buzz and intense sleepiness. Not surprisingly, then, Spurkle is recommended for the treatment of insomnia. It's also an effective means of treating ADHD, multiple sclerosis and other forms of spasticity. This strain carries on the potency of its parents, with THC levels exceeding 20% in at least one publicly available test. CBD numbers are much harder to come by, and that's usually a pretty clear indication that a strain shouldn't be used on conditions that require CBD, including severe seizure disorders. Spurkle has a sweet diesel aroma and a pungent Kush flavor, along with long, dense buds with rust red hairs. Users should expect the typical side effects, such as red eyes and dry mouth, though credible reports are hard to come by. Born in Southern California, Spurkle is sold on the medical market in San Diego – and that's about the only place it's found."
Special K Strain,"It features a smell that is both spicy and citrus. It offers a citrus taste that is very enjoyable. This is a pure Sativa strain that is a hybrid of Northern Lights and Afghani. It is potent with THC around 24% and it isn't recommended for first time users of cannabis. Special K is bright green in color. As the time comes near for harvesting, orange hairs will emerge. They will become brighter and brighter in the days leading up to the harvest. The leaves offer a very generous amount of crystals. The high from Special K is deliberate and long lasting. It can result in couch lock and it is hard to get much done mentally. It is best to use this strain when you will be at home and you don't need to get much else done. It can help with reducing stress and anxiety."
Sputnik Strain,Sputnik is a sativa dominant hybrid (70% sativa/30% indica) strain that is a potent cross between the hugely popular
Super MelonHead Kush Strain,"Though Super MelonHead Kush is known to be an indica-dominant hybrid, there isn't enough public information to gauge how much of it is sativa and how much indica. It's a close cousin to Super Kush, and in fact the two may simply be the same strain masquerading under different names. Like that strain, Super MelonHead Kush is a cross of Northern Lights #5 and Hindu Kush, both very popular in their own rights. There is little public data regarding THC levels in this strain, but there isn't any evidence to suggest they're especially high. CBD levels are also something of a mystery, but that alone means Super MelonHead Kush shouldn't be used as the sole means of treating seizures or other problems that respond to CBD. The indica-driven high is mostly physical, with calming, couch-lock effects, sleepiness, and intense hunger. That makes it a very useful tool in treating wasting and eating disorders, as well as insomnia and chronic pain. This strain has a fruity mango flavor, and it smells of watermelon. The buds are lime green with brown hairs. Look for Super MelonHead Kush in San Diego but don't expect to find it elsewhere."
Star Nebula Strain,"This super-galactic strain is indica-dominant, but the exact ratio of indica to sativa is hard to come by. It's a cross of Sensi Storm, a powerful indica-dominant hybrid, and Nebula, a sativa-dominant favorite. THC levels in Star Nebula aren't widely reported, but each parent has a relatively high concentration of the cannabinoid, so this strain likely also has high levels, possibly well over 20% in some cases. Even less is known about its CBD contents, though that alone suggests this strain shouldn't be used as the sole treatment of seizure disorders or other health conditions that respond to CBD. If its genetics are any guide, Star Nebula creates a powerful euphoria and a strong sedated sensation. Beyond that, there isn't much consistent information available about this strain's effects. But it is known to be an effective treatment for chronic pain, lack of appetite, insomnia, and anxiety. Star Nebula smells of lemon and Skunk, while the nugs have a dark green appearance with orange hairs. This strain is probably most common on the West Coast, though it might also be found in Colorado or even on the black market."
Sublime Strain,"Sublime is a sativa dominant hybrid (70% sativa/30% indica) strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and general disagreement in the cannabis community about its origins. It is widely thought that it is of the OG Kush family, although it is not known for sure. This dank bud boasts a moderately high THC level that ranges from 18-22% on average and a sweet aroma and taste of earthy floral spice with a hint of pineapple upon exhale. Users describe the Sublime high as being akin to drinking a pot of straight espresso. You'll feel an intensely uplifted cerebral head high almost immediately after smoking that leaves you insanely energetic and focused with high levels of motivation and creativity. This is accompanied by a pain relieving body buzz that's warming and relaxing, leaving you completely at ease with feelings of bliss and slight sedation. Although this high may be a little intense upon the initial hit, it becomes very manageable after the first few minutes. Due to these effects, Sublime is an ideal strain for treating nausea, stress, and pain. These buds have medium-sized dark forest green round grape-shaped dense nugs with almost translucent amber hairs and a fine layer of sandy white trichomes."
Super Blue Strain,"A sativa dominant hybrid, Super Blue is a grade A strain with the efficiency of Blue Dream. This mild orange and apple green nugget with dark hues is heavily covered with sticky trichomes, resembling morning dew. A mix of cerebral sativa and heightened indica, Super Blue Dream is a harmonious cure for pain and stress. The funky smell of blueberry and mint with hints of creamy yogurt gives an energetic uplift to productivity and creativity- a must-have for workaholics. The sweet haze of cream and yogurt with sensual clouds of mint and blueberry unlock the brain and give an average buzz of about 1 to 1.5 hours. Easy to smoke and inhale, this euphoric strain leaves you talkative and uplifted and is a cool way to relieve your stress, anxiety, depression, nausea and pain. The nugget is crispy and dry and might make eyes and mouth dry. Give a good blend to the strain and experience your creativity go wild with the pedal put to the metal."
Sugar Skunk Strain,"The genetics of Sugar Skunk are a little unclear, but this strain is known to be an indica-heavy hybrid (sativa/indica ratio unknown). It's a potent, pleasant choice for late nights and lazy days in front of the tube. Specific THC values are scarce, so it's hard to say just how potent this strain is, but it's definitely up there. The same can't be said about CBD contents, however, since the lack of public data suggests very low concentration. Patients who need that cannabinoid to treat seizures or other conditions shouldn't use Sugar Skunk as their only means of marijuana treatment. Rather, this strain produces a strong, happy body buzz that's ideal for medicating anxiety, nausea, and everyday stress. The aroma from Sugar Skunk is sweet and dank while the flavor is bittersweet, with citrus notes. The nugs are dense and dark green in appearance. Side effects are possible with any marijuana strain, and while there are few details on this one, they probably include cottonmouth and red eyes. Patients may find Sugar Skunk in medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado and Southern California."
Sweet Deep Grapefruit Strain,Sweet Deep Grapefruit is a 100% pure indica strain that's a cross between the famously tasty and widely popular
Sweet Dutch Strain,"Sweet Dutch, also known as ""Dutch Treat"" to most members of the cannabis community, is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy. This dank bud boasts a THC level ranging from 16-18% on average and is considered to be a staple strain in the Coffee Shops of Amsterdam. Users describe the Sweet Dutch high as having an immediate cerebral uplifting head rush that leaves you happy and focused. This is followed by a clean and calming numbing sensation that slowly spreads from the head and neck throughout the rest of the body, leaving you sleepy and sedated but not too couch-locked. Due to these potent effects, Dutch Treat is said to be an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress, pain due to injury or illness, depression, and insomnia. Dutch Treat has an aroma of sweet earthy pine and a taste of earthy pine that intensifies and sweetens upon exhale. Sweet Dutch buds have fluffy dark olive green popcorn shaped nugs that are completely covered in long thin fiery orange hairs and a fine layer of milky white trichomes. These nugs are completely sticky and practically dripping with syrupy sweet resin."
Super OG Master Kush Strain,"The indica genes are dominant in Super OG Master Kush, a three-way cross of Super Kush, OG Kush, and Master Kush (exact sativa/indica ratio unclear). This strain is said to be very potent, though there are few public reports on its THC levels. The same is true of CBD concentrations, which are reportedly lower than 1%, too low to recommend Super OG Master Kush as medication for severe epilepsy or other conditions that require CBD treatments. But it is known to be an effective form of relief for patients who suffer from anxiety, lack of appetite, muscle spasms, GI symptoms, and everyday stress. It's perfect for both encouraging hunger and treating upset stomach. The high is a blend of calming, euphoric body buzz and potent psychoactive effects. Super OG Master Kush has a citrus flavor and a dank smell of pine needles. The huge buds are bright green with gold hues, orange hairs, and a layer of frosty trichomes. This strain may produce side effects including cottonmouth and watery eyes, though details are scarce. In the United States, Super OG Master Kush sells almost exclusively in Southern California."
Tessa Strain,"Not many people have sampled this rare delicacy, but those lucky few seem to think very highly of it. That might be due in part to the high THC levels, rumored to exceed 22% in some tests. That puts it among the most potent available. CBD levels are hard to come by, but Tessa definitely isn't known for producing large amounts of this cannabinoid. That means this strain is a poor choice as an exclusive treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD. Tessa is a cross of The Black, a potent near-pure indica; Blueberry, a famed pure indica; and Dynamite, also an indica-heavy plant. Those genes make Tessa itself an indica-dominant strain, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica is unclear. The high is intensely physical, but beyond that not much is known about it. Couch-lock effects are a fair bet, as is sleepiness. That could make this a good choice for treating insomnia. It's also likely helpful with anxiety and depression, but otherwise the medical benefits of this strain are unclear. Tessa has a sweet flavor and a fruity aroma."
The Teenone Strain,"The Teenone is an indica dominant hybrid (70% indica/30% sativa) strain with unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy. This dank bud boasts an average THC level ranging from 10-20% and a potent myriad of both indica and sativa effects. Users describe the Teenone high as having an onset of an almost psychedelic head high that leaves you intensely energetic and uplifted. This is followed by a mellow relaxing body stone that slowly fades into a heavy full-body stone that leaves you utterly couch-locked and completely sedated. As the high continues, you'll experience significant body and mind relief and fade into a deep and peaceful sleep. Due to these potent effects, The Teenone is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic anxiety or stress, depression, or chronic pain due to injury or illness. The Teenone buds have small compact dense dark olive green spade-shaped nugs that are specked with thick furry fiery orange hairs. These nugs are caked with a frosty layer of white crystal trichomes and a fine sprinkling of sweet sticky resin. The Teenone has an aroma of pungent sweet fruity pine and a taste of pungent sweet fruit with a hint of pine upon exhale."
The Wiz Strain,"The Wiz, also known as ""Khalifa Kush"" to many members of the cannabis community, is a sativa dominant hybrid (80% sativa/20% indica) strain created by breeders at the infamous Karmaceuticals farms that was named after the famous rapper Wiz Khalifa. The exact genetics of this strain are unknown due to breeder secrecy, although it is widely agreed that it is an OG phenotype. This dank bud boasts a high THC level ranging from 14-22% on average and a myriad of both sativa and indica effects. Users describe The Wiz high as being super heavy for a sativa strain. You'll feel a strong cerebral head rush felt primarily in the forehead and eyes followed by a confusing combination of feelings of motivation and calming sedation. Due to these effects, The Wiz is an ideal strain for treating conditions such as glaucoma, insomnia, chronic stress, and mild to moderate cases of depression. The Wiz has an aroma of sour lemon pine and a taste of sweet and sour lemon with a hint of pungent pine upon exhale. The Wiz buds have small to medium-sized light minty green grape-shaped dense nugs that are spattered with thin fiery orange hairs. These nugs are super frosty with white trichomes and sticky with sweet resin."
Thai Lights Strain,"Thai Lights produces uplifting effects on your body and is a Sativa dominant strain. It was produced by mating Northern Lights with a sativa dominant Thai strain that originated from the Nakan Pranom region. It is a strong hybrid strain that has an indoor flowering period of around nine to eleven weeks. It has a good yield and results in frosted buds that are covered with trichomes. The buds have very long pistils that have an orange red color and cover the entire bud. Thai Lights produces a strong body buzz that lasts on your system for a very long time. It has cerebral effects that relax you and make you feel euphoric as well. It has a minty and refreshing aroma and a very pleasant flavor that is a blend of earthy, citrus and sour flavors. The strain has a calming effect on your body, which is why it is best for the medical patients of depression. It can also be used for treating migraines and helps in alleviating them soon. It has uses in neuropathy as well and is often used for curing different types of pains."
Third Dimension Strain,"Primarily a Sativa strain, it features a tropical fruit type of aroma when it's fully grown. Being a hybrid of Appolo 13 and Jack the Ripper, it's not surprising it has a average THC content of around 18%. Some of the effects of Third Dimension that are most commonly experienced are a nice long body high, and a pleasing cerebral head high. It also possesses the quality of making you laugh a lot, and feelings of euphoria are usual. It is typically used by medical smokers to help treat migraines, depression, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and many forms of arthritis. Most useful in combating depression, as many users who have used this strain to treat it will testify to. Patients will also get mad munchies from smoking this strain. The only downsides reported are the common cotton mouth and dry eyed syndrome."
Top 44 Strain,"Top 44 is a heavily indica dominant hybrid (90% indica/10% sativa) strain that was created by breeders at the infamous Nirvana Seeds. Its parentage is largely unknown due to the secrecy of its breeders, although it does boast a moderate THC level ranging from 8-15% on average. Top 44 is well known among the cannabis community for its intense couch lock and its description as the ""perfect nighttime bud."" Users describe the Top 44 high as an intense body high that is felt first in the head, face, and eyes before slowly melting throughout the body. This feeling is accompanied by a sense of euphoria that is still mellow and leaves you clear-headed. Following this initial high, users slowly fade into an intense couch lock that is extremely sedative and eases them into a deep and peaceful sleep. Because of these potent sedative effects, Top 44 is an ideal treatment for patients suffering from conditions such as chronic pain, nausea, insomnia, and depression. The Top 44 bud has a sweet and fruity aroma that is reminiscent of a lemon drop candy and a taste of fruity caramel that is extremely smooth upon exhale. This strain has big fluffy leafy nugs that are dark green with thin fiery orange hairs, a thick layer of caked-on crystals, and sweet resin."
Trinity Blueberry Strain,"Patients who use CBD cannabis to treat their medical conditions often have a hard time finding strains that meet their needs. Trinity Blueberry is one of the exceptions. This strain is known for its relatively high CBD content, topping 1% in some cases. THC is also high, however, exceeding 19% in publicly available tests. This means that while Trinity Blueberry may be effective at treating seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to CBD, it shouldn't be used to treat pediatric conditions. But it's an effective medical tool in treating anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Trinity Blueberry is a sativa-dominant hybrid, though it has a near-even balance of sativa and indica (sativa/indica ratio of roughly 55:45). It's a mix of Trinity County Kush out of Northern California and Blueberry, a legendary indica that also has roots in the Golden State. The high is euphoric and happy, with most of the effects centered on the head. But it's also deeply relaxing. Trinity Blueberry has a sweet, fruity smell with notes of pine trees, along with a flavor of blueberries. The bud is dark green with long strands of orange and purple."
Topicana Strain,Topicana is a rare evenly balanced hybrid strain (50% indica/50% sativa) crated through crossing the classic

Truly Fruity Strain,Truly Fruity is a sativa dominant hybrid (75% sativa/25% indica) strain created through a cross of the infamous
Green Huckleberry Strain,"Green Huckleberry, or “Huckleberry Crack,” is a rare sativa dominant hybrid strain created through crossing the infamous Green Crack with the potent Huckleberry strain. This bud brings on the delicious high-powered flavor of both of its parents strains and gives them an oomph with a potent cerebral high perfect for kicking back in the morning or early afternoon. Green Huckleberry has a sweet herbal berry flavor with a spicy exhale that lingers long after you toke. The aroma is very earthy and dank with a spicy berry overtone that’s incredibly fruity and pungent as the nugs are burned. The Green Huckleberry high is that of your typical powerful sativa, brining in high energy levels and euphoria for hours on end. You’ll feel a rush of happiness at the onset of the high that lifts you from any mental anguish or pain and eases you into happy bliss. As your head soars, a creeping buzzing energy will wash over your entire body, giving you the fuel that you need to tackle anything that comes your way. In combination with its high 15-20% average THC level, Green Huckleberry is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as chronic fatigue, depression, chronic stress, migraines, and chronic pain."
Twilight Indica Strain,"Twilight Indica is, as its name suggests, a pure indica (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100), an original landrace from Afghanistan. That means an intensely physical high driven by indica genes. It's a great way to treat anxiety, depression, muscle spasms, and everyday stress. The effects are euphoric and deeply calming, with full-body relaxation and moderate couch-lock. There isn't much information available on the THC or CBD levels of this strain, though limited reports suggest it's quite potent with THC. Too little is known about CBD concentration to recommend Twilight Indica as a treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to that chemical. This strain smells of lemons and citrus, with notes of diesel fuel, and tastes of smooth citrus. The nugs are golden-green, with yellow and rust red hairs. There are few reports of negative effects, but the most common usually include dry mouth, red eyes, and paranoia. A product of the Dutch Passion seed bank, Twilight Indica can be found in Amsterdam, Colorado, and a few other places. It's well liked by those who have tried it, but it's definitely rare."
U-dub Gold Strain,"U-Dub Gold, also known simply as “UW,” is an indica dominant hybrid strain of unknown Pacific Northwest Heritage. Despite nothing really being known about its past, U-Dub Gold comes straight from the University of Washington, where it was bred alongside sister strains such as UW Purp and UW Black. U-Dub Gold buds have dark olive green nugs with rich purple undertones and bright golden hairs that are completely caked in tiny golden crystal trichomes that seem to glisten in the light. The U-Dub Gold high is very relaxed in nature, much like any other classic indica. There’s really not too much of a difference in the high of this bud than any other indica, as it offers deep body relaxation and calming with a slightly sleepy and sedative feeling. These effects in combination with its high 23-24% average THC level makes U-Dub Gold an ideal choice for treating conditions such as chronic pain, insomnia, chronic stress, and muscle spasms. U-Dub Gold has a sweet tropical flavor that’s much like a pina colada with an orange garnish. The aroma is almost sickly sweet with a citrus overtone that’s accented by fruity earth and a touch of sugar."
KGB Strain,KGB is a slightly indica dominant hybrid strain (60% indica/40% sativa) created through crossing the classic Burma X
Juanita Strain,"Juanita, also known as “Juanita la Lagrimosa,” is an evenly balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain with unknown parentage due to a high level of breeder secrecy. Although the exact indica to sativa ratio of Juanita tends to be very balanced, many users find that it leans towards a sativa in terms of effects. The Juanita high is very calming and uplifting, powered by a super high CBD level of 6-8% and a low THC level of 8-10%. The high starts with a subtle lift that gives you a substantial mood boost and immediately relieves your mind of any mental pains or racing thoughts. This effect is accompanied by a sense of creative inspiration and a tendency to become more outgoing and social, although not giggly or too talkative. With its highly medicinal nature and relaxing effects, Juanita is said to be perfect for treating chronic pain, migraines or headaches, chronic stress or anxiety, inflammation, and muscle spasms or cramps. This bud has a fresh lemony flavor with hints of sweet earth and pine, and a mellow aroma of tangy lemons and earthy pine with a slight floral overtone. Juanita buds have grape-shaped bright neon green nugs with tons of fiery orange hairs and a sparse spattering of tiny golden crystal trichomes."
Sirius Kush Strain,"Sirius Kush, also known as “Purple Sirius Kush,” is a rare indica dominant hybrid (60% indica/25% sativa/15% ruderalis) strain created through crossing the classic"
fruit spirit Strain,Fruit Spirit is a sativa dominant hybrid (60% sativa/40% indica) strain created through a cross of the classic
Sugar in My Bowl Strain,"Sugar in My Bowl is a sativa dominant hybrid strain with unknown parentage due to its rarity and a high level of breeder secrecy regarding its heritage. Nonetheless, Sugar in My Bowl offers any sativa lover addictive cerebral effects as well as a taste that is completely out of this world delicious. Like its name suggests, the flavor of Sugar in My Bowl is almost overwhelmingly sweet with a candy kush taste that tickles your tongue long after you toke. The aroma is very mellow and sweet with a slightly spicy touch and a hint of deep kush. The Sugar in My Bowl high is definitely that of a typical heavy sativa, boasting uplifted and energetic effects powered by a moderate THC level that tops out at about 17%. The high hits you almost immediately after you exhale, wrapping your mind in a state of pure bliss and invigorating you with a sense of energy and purpose. You’ll be laser-focused and attentive to everything around you, although easily distracted. As you begin to come down from the high, you’ll be dropped into a ravenous case of the munchies that has you reaching for anything on hand. These effects make Sugar in My Bowl a great choice for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic anxiety or stress, appetite loss, chronic fatigue, and depression.

Panda Pebbles Strain,"Panda Pebbles is an evenly balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain created by the infamous breeder Panda. To make Panda Pebbbles, he took Sour Crème soaked in OG Chem oil and rolled it in OG Chem kief, effectively creating a supercharged version of Panda OG that packs THC levels of 30-40%, depending on who makes it of course. The Panda Pebbles high is insanely powerful and long-lasting, leaving you completely sedated and helplessly couch-locked within minutes of your first toke. The high hits hard and fast, making it ideal for more seasoned users rather than novices. Oftentimes the Panda Pebbles high ends in a deep and dreamless sleep that can last for hours on end without interruption. Because of these heavy effects, Panda Pebbles is perfect for treating experienced patients who suffer from conditions such as chronic pain, inflammation, muscle spasms, and chronic stress or anxiety.

Little Devil Strain,"A common hybrid strain is known as Little Devil. It has a very high THC content, about 60%. It doesn't take much of this cannabis to provide a person with a quality high that lasts for several hours. Since it does induce sleepiness, it is best to use it at night. This is a 70:30 Indica/Sativa strain. It grows well in a small amount of space which is very encouraging to those that are growing the plants indoors. Little Devil is dark green in color with plenty of cannabis that develops on the leaves. Even though it isn't a big plant, the yield is very generous. It will start to flower after about 3 weeks. Little Devil is used to help with a variety of needs. It is often taken by those that suffer from mild to moderate depression in order to help them improve mood. It can stimulate appetite for someone with an eating disorder or low appetite due to medications. It can also reduce pain and help reduce insomnia."
Purple Durban Strain,"With THC levels topping 20%, Purple Durban is another powerful choice for patients seeking relief from both mental and physical symptoms. CBD levels are less than 1%, making this a poor choice for patients who depend on that substance. Durban Poison has a sativa/indica ratio of 65:35, so the high is more cerebral, though there are also calming body effects. The dominant feeling is one of clear-headed energy and euphoria. This strain is perfect for treating depression, fatigue, poor appetite, and insomnia, though it can also be somewhat effective on chronic pain. Purple Durban is a cross of Durban Poison, a potent pure sativa, and Mendocino Purps, an indica-dominant hybrid commonly known as ""Purps."" It has a strong, hashy smell with notes of licorice and spice. Purple Durban has a sweet-and-spicy flavor. Adverse effects include dry mouth and dry eyes, though details are hard to come by. This strain is probably most common in California, home of Mendocino Purps, though it can be found in other places. The high THC levels make this an effective choice for many patients, assuming they can locate some."

Quebec Gold Strain,"There's some confusion about the use of the name ""Quebec Gold."" Technically it refers only to this strain, but it's often used to describe a wide range of similarly potent strains out of Quebec. This one, the real thing, is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an unknown ratio of sativa to indica. The strong, psychoactive high follows those sativa leanings, with calming yet focused effects that include an intense dose of euphoria, mental clarity, and a boost of happiness. It also delivers a powerful case of the munchies, ideal for treating eating and wasting disorders. Quebec Gold can be a good choice for medicating anxiety, depression, eye pressure, headaches, and everyday stress. THC is abundant in this strain, topping at least 18% in available tests. But CBD levels are far lower, far too low to recommend this strain as a good medicine for seizures or other conditions that respond to that substance. Quebec Gold produces a smell of citrus and lemon, while the flavor also includes notes of pine. As far as side effects go, dry mouth and red eyes are widely reported. This strain used to be very popular, but its time has largely passed; these days it's hard to find anywhere outside Canada."
Golden Temple Kush Strain,"Golden Temple Kush is an indica dominant hybrid (60% indica/40% sativa) strain with unknown Kush parentage due to a high level of breeder secrecy.

Golden Temple Kush has a sweet grapey flavor that’s accented by spicy kush with a super smooth exhale. The aroma is very spicy and dank, with a smell of rotten berries and sweet kush that can fill a room. This bud has oversized leafy olive green nug with rich purple undertones and leaves, dark orange hairs, and a thick coating of huge white crystal trichomes.

Snow Bud Strain,"Though not particularly potent – THC levels typically fall between 8% and 12% – Snow Bud is an effective medical tool for patients with anxiety and low mood. The high, what there is, is almost entirely cerebral, with a dose of happiness. That suggests the sativa genes are dominant in this hybrid from the Dutch Passion seed bank in Holland, though the exact sativa/indica ratio isn't widely known. Neither is the CBD content of Snow Bud, which is likely a descendant of an Afghani landrace and a South African strain. But the limited information available on CBD suggests there's not enough of it to effectively treat seizure disorders or other medical conditions that respond to that cannabinoid. The smell of this strain is decidedly Skunky, with hints of cinnamon, while the taste is essentially the same. The bud is light green in appearance, with bright orange hairs. There are few reports of common adverse effects, but dry mouth and red eyes are typically the most likely. Snow Bud occasionally appears in medical marijuana dispensaries in the American Southwest, but it might also be found on the West Coast."

The high has a creeping onset, slowly washing over you with a building sense of energy and motivation. Your spirits and mind will start to lift, giving you the energy you need to get up and moving.

Northwest Blackberry Strain,"Northwest Blackberry strain, also known as Blackberry Kush is an indica dominant hybrid strain.

The medical uses for this strain include the use as a painkiller for people suffering from chronic pains such as arthritis or other syndromes as well as for people suffering from insomnia and depression.

Expect to experience a euphoric body buzz, but be forewarned that it is a creeper, so it will take about 10 minutes before you feel the effects, and reaches full strength about half an hour after smoking. The effects normally last for around and hour and 15 minutes. It features a nice skunky / pine-sol kind of aroma, which isn't all that bad. The taste is a skunk, sour, dank, pine mix served with a side of dry mouth. Medicinally is used almost exclusively for pain, although it does help stress, seizures, insomnia, and anxiety.

Cinderella OG Strain,"Cinderella OG is a sativa-dominant product of Cinderella 99 and OG Kush, two highly powerful sativa-dominant hybrids. That potency apparently doesn't carry down to this strain, which rates rather poorly among patients. The exact THC concentration isn't widely known, and the same goes for CBD, but neither appears to be very high. The balance of sativa to indica isn't entirely clear, but it appears to have a ratio of at least 70:30. Not much is known about Cinderella OG's effects, but as a sativa-dominant strain, it is likely centered on the head rather than the body. That should mean increased energy and mental clarity, though there isn't enough available information to say for sure. The same is true of this strain's medical effects. But sativas tend to be psychoactive, with sensory effects, making them best for treating anxiety, depression, nausea, appetite problems, migraines, and pain. Like other details on Cinderella OG, it's hard to determine its typical taste and smell. This strain definitely isn't popular, and few patients have tried it. It's not clear where it's available, though the American West is the best bet."
Wappa Strain,"Wappa is a slightly indica dominant hybrid (60% indica/40% sativa) strain created by breeders at the infamous Paradise Seeds. This dank bud has unknown genetics due to breeder secrecy and boasts a moderate THC level ranging from 18-19% on average. Wappa has a delicious aroma of sweet fruit with a hint of diesel and a taste of intensely sweet fruity candy with a pine and diesel aftertaste upon exhale. Wappa buds have airy bright neon green Christmas tree-shaped nugs that are completely covered with curly leaves and frosty fine white crystal trichomes and sweet sticky resin. Users describe the Wappa high as having a powerful onset that is somehow pleasant rather than jarring. This onset leaves you with a luminous high that makes you spacey and introspective, oftentimes leading you to get lost in your own mind. You'll also experience heightened awareness of what is going on around you even though you may be non-responsive. This bud provides significant pain relief in both mind and body without the sedation and couch lock typical of indicas and indica dominant hybrids. Due to these potent effects, Wappa is said to be an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic stress, pain due to injury or illness, depression, and insomnia."

Ginger Ale Strain,"Ginger Ale is produced by crossing Cinderella 88 and Café Girl. It is one of those hybrid strains that are not to be trifled with. With THC content that falls anywhere in between 20 and 25%, it proves to be one of the finest hybrid strains you can get your hands on. The strain produces tight nuggets that are bright green in color with good trichome coverage. Ginger Ale is a frosty strain and it may not necessarily appeal to most cannabis users. But then again, it has an amazing taste and smell that is more or less the same. You can expect floral and sweet flavors, which is quite smooth during the inhale and exhale. The strain is a hard hitter. It will hit you with everything it's got which is why it is not recommended for individuals new to smoking cannabis. However, its effects are rather calming and you will feel a body buzz unlike any other. Most individuals may even pass out due to its potency. Considering its effects, it is no surprise why the strain is recommended for nighttime use. On the other hand, it is quite effective at treating several medical conditions, including chronic pains, insomnia and even muscle spasms."

Most agree it's a blend of Durban Poison, OG Kush, and Cherry Kush, but some say it's a sativa-dominant hybrid while others insist it's a near-pure indica. This strain isn't widely available, so it's hard to know for sure, but the mostly physical high suggests the indica genes are important in this strain, if not dominant. The effects include a calming body buzz that's effective in relieving muscle cramps and mood disorders. THC concentrations aren't widely reported, but like it's parents, this strain is said to be quite potent. A similar lack of data about CBD levels means patients, including those with seizure disorders, shouldn't use Super Girl Scout Cookies as a source of that cannabinoid. The nugs are dense and green with orange hairs, but there isn't much information available about the taste or smell of this strain. Negative effects likely include dry mouth and dry eyes, though reliable reports are hard to come by. Super Girl Scout Cookies can be found at a handful of medical marijuana dispensaries in Southern California but it's rare elsewhere."

Vanilla Bean Strain,"Vanilla Bean, also known as “Vanilla Kush” or “Vanilla Bean Kush,” is an indica dominant hybrid (70% indica/30% sativa) strain created through crossing the delicious"
Ogre OG Strain,"Ogre, Ogre OG, and Ogre Kush all appear to be the same strain, though there's plenty of room for confusion. It appears to be a clone-only, indica-dominant descendant of Master Kush, Skunk #1, and Bubba Kush, itself an offspring of OG Kush. The sativa/indica ratio is roughly 30:70. A good choice for insomnia and pain, Ogre OG is also useful as medication for everyday stress and worry. The indica high is mostly physical, with deep relaxation and couch-lock effects, though the sativa genes also provide mental focus. This strain has a Skunky aroma and flavor with notes of sour citrus. The nugs are a multicolored blend of dark green, bluish-purple, and bright red. THC levels are modestly impressive in Ogre OG, reaching a maximum of nearly 19% in available tests. On the other hand, CBD is scarce in this strain, making it a poor choice for the alleviation of seizures or other conditions that respond to that chemical. The usual negative effects are reported: dry mouth, watery eyes, and paranoia, as well as limited dizziness and headaches. Ogre OG sells fairly well on the West Coast, in Arizona, and in Colorado."
Hempstar Strain,"Hempstar is a sativa dominant hybrid with a 10:90 indica/sativa ratio. Hempstar is a cross between Haze, Oasis and Skunk. With an exceptional 25% THC content the strain is not to be taken lightly. Hempstar is also popularly referred to as Brainstorm and produces dense nuggets that are covered with dark green leaves. Moreover, you will even notice hues of purple with a fine amount of red hair seeping through the surface all the while being extremely sticky and frosty at the same time. Hempstar smells quite fruity which is unusual considering its heritage. But then again, it tastes more or less the same with earthy undertones. One of the best things about Hempstar is that its high lasts for no less than three hours. As soon as you begin smoking the strain, you will feel the high overcome your body and mind. You will not only feel extremely relaxed but you will happy as well. The strain is better known for its medical applications. On several occasions it has proven to be successful at treating medical conditions like schizophrenia, severe insomnia, depression, anxiety and loss of appetite."
Power Plant Strain,"This relatively upbeat strain is an inbred descendant of native South African sativas, though it also has some indica genes (65:35 sativa/indica ratio). THC levels vary, as they do with any strain, but available data suggests they're not especially high, at least not on average. CBD levels are sometimes high, especially for a strain that appeals to recreational uses. Even so, it varies and isn't generally high enough to suggest Power Plant as a treatment for seizures or other conditions that can be treated with CBD. Instead, it's good for anxiety and depression, fatigue, ADHD, inflammation, migraine headaches, and lack of appetite. Use this strain for early afternoons or, if you wake and bake, mornings, as it provides a clear-headed boost of energy, with a creative spark and happy euphoria. Power Plant has a sweet taste with earthy, woody flavors. The aroma is similarly sweet, earthy, and woody. The bud is light green with light brown flecks and a silvery dusting of trichomes. Red eyes and cottonmouth are both common side effects, while paranoia and mild headaches are also possible for some users. This isn't the world's most popular strain, but it's found in a surprising number of legal markets, both in the American West and in Europe."

A light buzzy tingle will begin to build in your limbs as your mental state expands, slowly working its way through the rest of your body and leaving you incredibly relaxed without being sedated or weighted down. With these effects and its super high 21-31% average THC level, Sour Patch Kiss is often chosen to treat conditions such as chronic fatigue, depression, ADD or ADHD, chronic pain, and chronic stress. This bud has oversized spade-shaped minty green nugs with rich amber hairs and a coating of tiny amber crystal trichomes."
OG Wreck Strain,"Two famed strains gave birth to this powerful sativa-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of roughly 30:70): OG Kush and Trainwreck. The THC level of OG Wreck is uncertain, as is the CBD level. But it's probably safe to assume this strain is low in the cannabinoid CBD and not a good choice for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to it. The high is almost entirely cerebral, with euphoric energy and a peppy mood boost. It's great for alleviating anxiety and depression, as well as physical fatigue, migraines and other headaches, chronic pain, and inflammation. Bloodshot eyes and cottonmouth are both common, while paranoia is less likely. OG Wreck has a strong, sour skunky odor with hints of pine, nuts, and soil, and tastes like fruit and black pepper. The buds are long and chunky thanks to the plant's OG genes, and they're covered with dense, frosty trichomes so white they almost have a bluish tint. This strain is typically found only in California and British Columbia. It has a devoted following, but their numbers are few and they're nearly as hard to find as OG Wreck itself."

RD-12 Strain,"Take the genes of Big Bud, Shiva, and a Hawaiian indica, mix them together, and you've got RD-12, a rare indica-dominant hybrid with an unknown ratio of sativa to indica. This strain is fairly strong, with THC levels of at least 16% in some tests. CBD, meanwhile, is nearly nonexistent, roughly 0.03% in the same tests, so RD-12 shouldn't be used as the sole treatment for epilepsy or other conditions that can be relieved with CBD. The high is almost entirely physical and comes with a pleasant body buzz, calming effects, couch-lock, and sleepiness. That makes this an ideal medical choice for relieving sleeplessness, though it's also helpful with tumors, chronic pain, migraines and other headaches, and inflammation. RD-12 has a sweet taste of earth and wood, while it smells of blueberries and Skunk. Though reports of negative effects are few and far between, that's mostly because this strain is so rare. In any event, dry mouth, dry eyes, and paranoia are typically the most common side effects when smoking marijuana. This strain could conceivably be purchased on the legal markets in California and the rest of the American West, but it's definitely not a common selection."

The taste of Super Goo is exotic and fruity but it does offer a dank and musky smell that some people have a hard time getting past. It can offer an Earthy smell as well as the scent of lemon. For those that give it a try, the taste and the benefits from it are more than worth putting up with a scent they aren't particularly fond of.

Sugar Mama Strain,"With THC levels that have tested at greater than 19%, Sugar Mama is a potent near-pure indica hybrid created by crossing Big Bud with Blueberry, both strong indica-dominant hybrids. CBD levels are very low, making Sugar Mama a poor choice for seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to that cannabinoid.

This strain is best reserved for late at night or for days with limited obligations.

It's an indica cross of Ice Princess and Cinderella 99 (0:100 sativa/indica ratio), and though it delivers a deeply relaxing creeper of a body high, it isn't especially powerful. The effects are happy and giggly, creative and euphoric, sleepy and lazy, making this a good choice for patients with anxiety, nausea, pain, lack of appetite, and insomnia. Purple Princess has moderate THC levels that hover around 19% in available samples.

The buds look glossy and compact and the tropical greens are masked by a white sheen, making it more irresistible than it already is. The leaves vary in color, from dark to light green.

Casey Chocolate Thai Strain,"This strain is a rare combination of Casey Jones, a popular sativa-heavy hybrid, and OG Chocolate Thai, a sativa-dominant strain.

The nugs have a dark green tint with purple hues and a layer of crystals on the surface of the bud. This strain, which is said to be similar to Green Crack, apparently doesn't pack the same punch as that potent strain. THC levels are hard to come by but don't appear to be terribly high. There is even less available information on CBD contents, but that alone suggests Casey Chocolate Thai shouldn't be used as the only source of medical treatment for seizures. On the other hand, this strain's mostly physical effects make it a good way to treat anxiety, headaches, inflammation, chronic pain, and sleeplessness.

It goes without saying Hong Kong offers more of a body buzz than a cerebral one and will make you feel sleepy in no time.

Tootsie Roll Strain,"Two favorite chocolate strains, Chocolope and Chocolate Thai, were merged to create this sativa-dominant hybrid with an unknown sativa/indica ratio. The bud is multi-colored, with flecks of purple, red, green, and brown, and it smells of sweet chocolate. Tootsie Roll tastes of chocolate and fudge, as its name suggests. It's hard to judge just how potent this strain is, since THC levels aren't widely reported. But its mixed parentage – Chocolope is high in THC and Chocolate Thai isn't – suggests it's a moderately potent medical selection. Reliable data on CBD levels are likewise hard to come by, and that means Tootsie Roll probably shouldn't be used as the only source of cannabis treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD. The effects of this strain are mostly cerebral, with energy, happiness, and calming mental relief. It's a great way to treat anxiety, depression, mood disorders, chronic pain, and everyday stress. Negatives may include dry eyes or dry mouth, though there are few public reports on the subject. Look for this delicious strain in California or Arizona; elsewhere it's relatively rare."
Colombian Gold Strain,"Colombian Gold is some seriously old-school marijuana. A close relative of the even more famous Acapulco Gold, this strain was born in the Santa Marta mountains of Colombia and exploded across the United States in the 1960s. Its popularity has since faded dramatically, but it remains an effective tool for treating muscle spasms and chronic pain. THC levels in this strain reportedly test above 19%, so it's a relatively potent choice for patients seeking a calming, energizing, clear-headed cerebral high that can also be used to treat anxiety and depression. CBD levels are much harder to come by, though Colombian Gold has been used to crossbreed strains that are high in that cannabinoid. Still, without more reliable information, this strain shouldn't be used as the sole medication for conditions that respond to CBD, including seizure disorders. Colombian Gold is a near-pure sativa (sativa/indica ratio of at least 75:25), the result of an original Colombian landrace strain. It delivers a smooth but tangy tea flavor and a Skunky aroma with notes of lemon and lime. The buds are covered in visible crystals. Though well past its prime, Colombian Gold still sells relatively well in Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, and Arizona."

The same goes for its effects, though this strain's indica leanings suggest the high is primarily physical. Like other indicas, it is probably best used late at night or on rainy days, as couch-lock is possible. There is little available information on White Ice's medical applications. Its chemical composition is also somewhat uncertain, though some tests report THC levels as high as 20% and CBD levels below 1%. That means this strain is best used for its THC content and shouldn't be used as the only treatment of seizure disorders or other problems that are alleviated with CBD. Negative effects mostly likely include dry eyes and red eyes. White Ice is definitely a specialty strain, so it's hard to find. But it does sell in California and possibly elsewhere in the American West."

Stutterlicious OG Strain,"It probably won't give you a stutter, but this potent, even hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of 50:50) will deliver mighty couch-lock, making it a good choice for rainy days and late nights at home. Stutterlicious is the offspring of Banana OG and Shark's Breath, both relatively even mixes of sativa and indica. THC levels register fairly high in available tests, at least 18%. But CBD levels are largely unknown, and that alone means patients shouldn't use this strain as their sole treatment for seizures or other disorders that require CBD. Despite the 50/50 split, the high of Stutterlicious is largely body-focused, with relaxing laziness and occasional immobility. The THC makes this a likely choice for anxiety and depression, as well as other mental health problems. Beyond that not much is known about its medical benefits. Stutterlicious has a skunky aroma and flavor, with strong hints of banana. The buds are lime green with orange hairs. Few patients have reported side effects, but that's probably because so few have tried this strain. Stutterlicious OG can be found in Nevada and possibly California, but it's rare in most places."

The high is a combination of cerebral and body buzz, with an immediate head rush followed by a deeply relaxing indica high. As its name suggests, it smells and tastes of oranges and other varieties of citrus. The high may be useful in treating anxiety and depression, but beyond that its potential uses are largely unexplored. Orange Sunshine is known to be relatively strong, but exact THC contents aren't publicly available. The same is true of CBD concentrations, though this strain isn't recommended for patients whose conditions respond to that cannabinoid. Information about negative effects is limited, though dry mouth and red eyes are probably most common.

The flavor is sweet, tropical, and fruity, while the aroma is similar. The nugs are a mix of dark and light green, together with amber hairs and a healthy layer of trichomes on the surface.

Outer Space has almost no CBD, so it's not a good selection for medicating seizure disorders or other conditions with symptoms that respond to CBD treatments. But THC levels are impressive, with available tests showing maximum results above 20%. That means a more potent, long-lasting high from this sativa-dominant cross of Mix of Trinity and Island Sweet Skunk, both sativa-heavy hybrids; the exact ratio of sativa to indica isn't widely known.

"G Stik ""Rosado"" Strain","G Stik ""Rosado"" is primarily a sativa strain. Unlike other sativa strains, it has an exceptionally high THC content which exceeds 25%. Even though the buds do not look like much at first, upon closer inspection they prove exquisite as they are bright green in color with good crystal and trichome coverage. But that is not all. It is not as sticky as other sativa strains. On the other hand, the strain does not have much to offer in terms of taste and smell. It is flowery but that is not enough to tempt cannabis users to give it a try. The strain does not tire you out but will in fact energize you beyond measure. You will find it easier to concentrate and focus thus being able to get things done. This alone is more than enough reason for you to use as a daytime strain. There is no doubt that G Stik ""Rosado"" is the perfect wake and bake strain. The high will make you feel euphoric and happy which is just what you will need to remain productive of the rest of the day. But that is not all. The strain is equally effective at treating patients suffering from depression, anxiety and depression."
Citrus Kush Strain,"Citrus Kush may have noble beginnings: It's a descendant of original Kush plants from the Afghan mountains. But that doesn't mean it's a particularly popular strain itself. This is an indica-dominant hybrid with a sativa/indica ratio of at least 30:70. The body buzz is long lasting and intensely physical, suggesting this is a relatively potent strain. But THC numbers aren't easy to come by, and the same goes for CBD content. Still, it seems a safe bet that CBD levels are much lower than THC. Effective CBD strains are usually better advertised than this. Use Citrus Kush to treat depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, wasting, eating disorders, migraine headaches, muscle spasms, and chronic body pains. Citrus is the dominant aroma and flavor, giving this strain its name. The aroma also includes specific notes of lemon and orange, along with sweet and sour smells. The taste, on the other hand, is also tropical with hints of Bubble Gum. The bud is a medium green color with light amber strands and a frosting of trichomes. Few places sell this rarity, but it's probably easier to locate on legal markets in the American West."
Purple Buddha Strain,"This product of crossbreeding between Mendocino Purps and Blue Buddha, this indica-dominant strain smells of grapes and has a pleasant, creamy berry flavor. The exact balance of indica to sativa is unknown, though the indica genes are clearly dominant. Likewise, there isn't much information on the THC or CBD contents of Purple Buddha, but it's a fairly potent choice for relaxation and stress relief. Expect a strong body high with couch-lock effects. Laziness and euphoria are the strongest aspects of the buzz, which can also be focused and giggly. Purple Buddha is best for treating anxiety, chronic pain, and mood disorders. It's also a good treatment for insomnia, as the body effects induce sleepiness. This strain produces a smooth smoking experience with a sweet berry flavor and a sharp pungent aroma. Dry mouth is the most frequent side effect, while red eyes and dizziness are also possible. Purple Buddha is found mostly in California and Arizona, while some Michigan dispensaries also sell it. It can be found on the black market but isn't common there. Nonetheless, it's a reliable choice from patients who need the physical relief only a good indica can provide."

Purple Cream Strain,"Ideal for anxiety and late night relaxation, Purple Cream is an indica-dominant hybrid of unknown lineage (sativa/indica ratio isn't widely reported). It delivers moderate, physical effects that relax the body and ease stress. The high is sedative and long lasting, great for treating insomnia and chronic pain. Couch-lock effects are common, so save this strain for late nights. THC numbers vary widely from one batch to another, with some samples testing at roughly 10% and others topping 18%. But generally it's known to be relatively weak, so it's a good option for patients who are just starting with medical marijuana and for infrequent tokers. CBD concentrations also low, under 1%, which is much too low to make this a good strain for treatment of seizures and other maladies that respond to that chemical. Purple Cream has a smooth, fruity flavor and a similar aroma with floral notes. The nugs are dense and sticky, with purple leaves, orange hairs, and trichome crystals. Watery eyes are the most widely reported negatives with this strain, while dry mouth is also common and paranoia, dizziness, and anxiety are possible but less likely."

Thai Stick Strain,"Thai Stick is a rare 100% sativa strain that is native to Thailand and was brought over to the United States during the 70s or 80s, depending on who you ask. This bud gets its name from its unique method of smoking it – typically you skewer the buds on long thin bamboo sticks. These nugs are tied to the sticks using stringy fibers pulled from the cannabis plant itself. After being secured, these nugs are often dipped in hash oil for added potency. Despite the unique method of smoking Thai Stick, it does have a fairly typical sativa high, although it can add a sense of clarity at times. The high starts slowly, infusing you with a growing sense of euphoria that eventually reaches its peak and leaves you feeling uplifted and slightly motivated. As your mind is boosted into complete happiness, your body will be washed over with a feeling of calming relaxation that doesn’t affect your ability to move but can leave you feeling exceptionally lazy.

Cheddar Cheese Strain,"It's hard to find much of any information on this rare cheese strain. There seems to be some confusion as to exactly where it comes from, and the term ""cheddar cheese"" may be used to refer to other, unrelated strains. The real thing has a 50:50 ratio of sativa to indica. That means this strain should deliver a mix of mind and body effects, ideal for relieving daytime stress. CBD levels are low in Cheddar Cheese, so it isn't the best choice for treating conditions that respond to that chemical. But THC levels are high, making this a potent choice for mood disorders and anxiety. Purportedly a descendant of Skunk #1 and an original Afghani strain, it's a close cousin of the original UK Cheese. Like that strain, Cheddar Cheese has a sharp, skunky cheese aroma and flavor. The buds have a light green appearance with dark orange hairs and a thick layer of glistening trichomes.

That means Orange Dream can be a useful treatment for seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to CBD. The exact ratio of sativa to indica is unknown, however. As a sativa, Orange Dream delivers a euphoric, upbeat punch with a strong dose of creativity and contrasting feelings of laziness. This strain can be used to treat anxiety, mood disorders, lack of appetite, and chronic pain. Dry mouth and dry eyes are relatively common, but other adverse effects are more rare. Orange Crush is an ideal choice for busy days and social situations, as it provides a spirited boost of energy. Found mostly in California and Washington State, this strain is relatively rare in other parts of the United States."

It's a clone-only descendant of Blueberry and Kryptonite, both strong, heavy indicas. The exact ratio of sativa to indica in this strain is unclear, though it's classified as a hybrid. The effects appear to be mostly cerebral, suggesting the sativa genes are strong if not dominant in Kryptonite Blue. The high is alert, energized, and mentally focused. While THC levels are relatively high, CBD levels definitely aren't. At less than 1% CBD, Kryptonite Blue is not recommended as the only medicine for health problems that respond to CBD, including seizure disorders. This strain has an earthy, woody flavor and a similar smell, while the nugs are a patchwork of green leaves and grayish-brown hairs. There are few reports of side effects, but patients should expect the usual problems: dry eyes, paranoia, and dry mouth. Kryptonite Blue can be found on Arizona's legal medical market, but it's rare pretty much everywhere else."

As for the taste, it is just as strong as its smell during the inhale and is exceptionally sweet and smooth at the same time. George Bush has plenty to offer for almost all cannabis users. The strain got its name because most cannabis users are unable to make a sentence after medicating with it due to its potency. You will experience symptoms of euphoria and will feel extremely happy. As soon as you take a hit, you will feel relaxed and stoned in no time.

The buds are a light green color with occasional splotches of purple and a thick frosting of resinous trichomes. THC concentration is high in the strain, coming in at more than 21% in some tests. CBD concentration, meanwhile, is very low, much less than 1%. In other words, Cherry Kola isn't a great choice for alleviating the symptoms of epilepsy or other conditions that respond to CBD. But it is good for treating other medical conditions, including anxiety, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. The high is body-centered, promoting deep relaxation and peaceful sleep. It's best used at night, given its powerful sedative qualities and couch-lock effects. There are few reports of negative effects, but bloodshot eyes and dry mouth are probably most common. Paranoia may also be possible. Look for this strain in the Pacific Northwest; you're unlikely to find it elsewhere."

But during the exhale it is more or less the same as its smell. One of the best things about the Caboose is that its effects can last anywhere in between two to three hours.

It shouldn't be used as the only form of treatment for seizure disorders, however, or for other conditions that respond to CBD, as Ice has little of that chemical.

Bubba OG Strain,"CBD levels are low in this indica-dominant hybrid (20:80 sativa/indica ratio), about 0.4%, so Bubba OG isn't ideal for patients who need that chemical. But THC levels are very high, topping 22% and possibly even 25%. That makes for a lazy, potent body high that reduces stress, sparks hunger, and encourages sleep. Those body effects make Bubba OG great for treating lack of appetite, chronic pain, insomnia, and anxiety, as well as headaches and depression. Dry mouth is a fairly common side effect, as are red eyes, but most other negatives are rare. This strain has a strong, pungent earthy flavor with a floral aroma. It's not exactly clear how Bubba OG came to be, though it almost certainly owes some of its genes to the original OG Kush, a supremely powerful sativa-dominant hybrid that's popular almost everywhere. Bubba OG, by contrast, is usually found in California (home of OG Kush), Arizona, Colorado, and British Columbia. It occasionally appears on the black market, but it generally isn't as sought after as some of its Kush cousins. Still, it's a favorite of many medical users."
Diesel Thai Strain,"Diesel Thai is a rare sativa dominant hybrid (70% sativa/30% indica) strain created through crossing the infamous Thai with an unknown member of the Diesel family.

Thanks to these well-balanced effects and its super potent THC level, Diesel Thai is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as depression, mood swings, chronic fatigue, and chronic stress. It should not be used if you suffer from anxiety. Diesel Thai buds have lumpy forest green nugs with bright orange hairs and a dusty coating of golden crystal trichomes. This bud has a sweet and sour spicy candy flavor with a citrus herbal aroma to match."

OG Shark Strain,"This potent favorite is hard to find, especially in the United States, but it's popular throughout Canada, where it was born. The biggest selling point is its impressive THC concentration, with top levels easily exceeding 20%. CBD content is almost zero, so OG Shark shouldn't be used for seizure disorders or other conditions helped by CBD. The strain is a hybrid, though the precise ratio of sativa to indica seems to be a mystery. OG Shark has a pungent earthy aroma, with tones of blueberry and diesel. The genetics are unknown, but based on its smell and taste it may descend from the original Blueberry and Diesel strains. The high is largely cerebral, suggesting strong sativa genes, with powerfully upbeat euphoria, relaxation, and creativity. It can treat a wide variety of problems: depression, headaches, lack of appetite, nausea, and insomnia. Negative effects likely include cottonmouth and red eyes. This strain is very highly regarded by those who have tried it, but American patients will have a hard time getting their hands on it without going to Canada in person. It sells across that country but is most popular in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Nova Scotia. It occasionally sells in Washington State, directly across the border from British Columbia, but it's scarce there."

Green Monster Strain,"Green Monster is one of the few sativa dominant strains that offer an all-time high along with its medicinal affects. There is more to the strain than meets the eye as it is incredibly potent and it has an astounding 27% THC content as well. Even though the buds are not extraordinary they are quite dense and may just be what you were looking for all along. As for the smell, it is an exquisite blend of pungent, piney and earthy scents along with unique woody, candy and lemon flavors for you to enjoy. The strain is known as Green Monster for good reason. The green buds do more than just relax your body and mind. It is known for offering a sensational cerebral experience which may lead you to question your own sanity. Keeping this in mind, individuals new to smoking cannabis are advised to stay clear of the strain. Even the most experienced of users find it incredibly difficult to stay fully aware of themselves or their surroundings while medicating with the strain. Additionally, the strain can give you the munchies as well which is why it would be a good idea to have some snacks lying around. However, it is worth noting that the strain has several medical applications and can be used for treating insomnia, stress, chronic aches and depression."
King Kong Strain,"King kong is a cross between Buddha Cheese and White Widow Reversed. True to its name, King Kong, aka King Kong Kush, is an especially potent indica-dominant hybrid with a sativa/indica ratio of 20:80. The buds, however, are smaller than the name suggests, with a dark green leafy appearance. The flavor is earthy with skunk tones, while the smell is strong and pungent. Solid THC concentrations are hard to come by, as are figures regarding CBD contents in this strain. But it has a reputation as a powerful medical choice with strong, calming body effects and a euphoric boost of happiness. King Kong is best used to relieve symptoms of body pains, insomnia, anxiety, lack of appetite, and severe PMS. Possible side effects include the usual: dry mouth and bloodshot eyes. Headaches and dizziness are also reported but are less common. It's not entirely clear where King Kong comes from, though its mother was apparently an Ed Rosenthal Super Bud plant, itself a strong indica-dominant hybrid. This strain is relatively common on the black market; on the legal market it's most commonly found in California, Colorado, Arizona, Washington State, and British Columbia."

Raskal White Fire OG Strain,"Raskal White Fire OG is a rare, select breeding of White Fire OG, itself a sativa-dominant hybrid with a sativa/indica ratio of 60:40. White Fire – and presumably Raskal's White Fire – is a cross of Fire OG and The White, a pairing that produces a strong diesel smell and a thick coating of resinous crystals on the bud. THC levels are said to be massive in this strain, potentially topping 24%. That concentration should make for an intense but calming, happy, and sociable cerebral high. Raskal's White Fire can be used to relieve anxiety, low mood, and lack of appetite, as it generates powerful hunger. It shouldn't be used as the only source of treatment for seizure conditions, however, as it's low in CBD. Not much is known about this plant, including its aroma, flavor, and appearance, but to judge by the original White Fire, this strain likely has a pungent fuel smell with sweet, earthy tones. Adverse effects could include dry eyes, dry mouth, dizziness, anxiety, and headaches. The original White Fire can be found throughout the United States, from the West Coast and Arizona to Colorado and Michigan; it's not clear where Raskal's version sells, but those are probably the best bets."
Three Blue Kings Strain,Three Blue Kings is an evenly balanced hybrid strain (50% indica/50% sativa) created through a cross of the classic
Crystal Coma Strain,"Crystal Coma is a sativa dominant strain with a 30:70 indica/sativa ratio. What is really interesting about the strain is that it creates a spectacular 27% THC content, which is quite unusual considering its heritage. Crystal Coma is a cross between Skunk and Cheese and is incredibly potent. Keeping this in mind, it is not for the faint of heart. The strain is known for giving experienced users a run for their money at the same time. Upon closer inspection, you will come to realize the buds are tree-shaped, lime green in color and with orange hairs. As for the smell, it is an intense blend of pine and lemon with cheesy undertones. On the other hand, Crystal Coma does taste clean and crisp with hints of spice.

The strain gives off a sweet and minty aroma thereby giving the complete meaning of its name. Similar to the aromas, the flavors of this strain are also found to be minty and sweet. Having got the powers of both indica and sativa strains from the ancestors, this strain is able to provide a whole body effect thereby providing the strain with the exceptional fame. As this strain is known to give higher psycho-activity, this is not advised for the beginners. Thin Mint is known to be effective for the symptoms of pain, sleep disorders, loss of appetite, nausea and swelling. This can also be taken for depression, stress, muscle spasm and tremors."
Wonder Woman Strain,"A potent and rich strain, this hybrid can produce an indica dominant as well as a satica dominant plant.

The aroma is sweet and floral, with sweet hints of pine and soil, while the flavor is subtle but tart. The cone-shaped buds have a dark green color with frosty encrusted trichomes blanketing the surface. THC levels are largely a mystery, as are CBD contents. But it isn't widely known as a CBD strain, so it probably shouldn't be used as the sole treatment for patients with seizures. The indica genes produce a calming body buzz while the sativa delivers clear-headed, energetic cerebral effects. Use Purple Alien to treat anxiety, depression, mood disorders, irritability, and everyday stress. There are few public reports of side effects, but dry mouth, dry eyes, and paranoia are probably the most common.

AK-47 is a sativa-dominant hybrid. AK-48, on the other hand, is indica-heavy (sativa/indica ratio of roughly 35:65), though some reports claim it leans more toward its sativa genes. AK-47 and AK-48 do share one thing: They're both known to be very potent, with top THC levels of roughly 20% in each case.

The high is a combination of a physical body-sedating stone, and an invigorating cerebral reaction. Medically, it is getting plenty of use as a great reliever of insomnia and lack of appetite. Indoors, the Kong can reach medium heights, growing taller when outside. Having generous, midway green leaves, and compact buds that are large and flowered with plenty of silvery crystal, this strain is good for the average smoker or those who are new to smoking their meds."
Aceh Strain,"Aceh, also known more commonly as “Atjeh,” is a 100% pure sativa landrace strain that is one of several varieties that are native to the Aceh region of Indonesia. Although this bud is hard to get ahold of in the western hemisphere, it is beloved for its classic flavor and aroma. Aceh has an insanely delicious taste of sweet tropical earth with a woody pungency that lingers on your tongue long after you finish smoking. The aroma is just a sweet, with an earthy herbal smell that is accented sweetly by a skunky pungency that’s released as the nugs are broken apart and smoked. The Aceh high is that of a typical powerful sativa strain, with uplifting and energizing effects that are not too overwhelming for users of any age. It starts with a euphoric rush that hits you hard almost immediately after smoking with a happy and uplifted feeling that is insanely energized. You’ll feel motivated, focused, and creative with a sense of purpose. This is accompanied by a surprisingly relaxing effect that doesn’t sedate you or weight you down in any way. These effects and its THC level of 10% or greater makes Aceh the perfect bud for treating conditions such as chronic fatigue, mild to moderate cases of depression, chronic stress, and nausea. This bud has large and lumpy super dense spade-shaped bright forest green nugs with lots of fiery orange hairs and a super thick frosty coating of tiny white crystal trichomes."

Blackberry Rhino has a sweet berry flavor and a floral aroma. The buds are light green with a frosting of trichomes and light strands of brown. Some sources claim soaring THC levels, but customer ratings don't really support that. More reliable tests peg THC at about 16%, while CBD concentrations are very low, well below 1%, meaning you probably shouldn't use this strain to treat seizures or other problems that can be treated with CBD. But you can use it to relieve anxiety, lack of appetite, nausea, pain, and insomnia. The high combines body and cerebral effects, delivering a physical buzz and a clear-headed dose of good mood.

Medical smokers use this strain to decrease the symptoms of appetite loss, pain, and anxiety. The high is very strong and very clear, meaning you aren't looking at couchlock.

He's the world's premier stoner balladeer, and he's smoked more marijuana than the rest of country music combined. With a top THC content of 19-26%, this isn't an atomic strain, but it can be a great medical tool for arthritis, migraines, and seizure disorders.

Redhead 18 Strain,"Though exact THC details are hard to come by, Redhead 18 or R-18 is known to be one of the most potent strains on the market. It's a phenotype descendant of OG Kush and is similar to the old OG #18 strain. This strain is a hybrid, but there isn't much information to determine the exact balance of sativa to indica genes. Though THC numbers are allegedly very high, CBD numbers almost certainly are not; it's hard to say for sure, as there is only limited public data on the subject. In other words, Redhead 18 shouldn't be used in the treatment of seizures or other medical disorders that respond to CBD. But it's a very useful tool for patients looking to relieve the symptoms of anxiety and stress. The high, which hints at this strain's sativa heritage, is euphoric and happy. This strain creates a strong, sour aroma of diesel and a similar flavor with notes of wood. There aren't many reports of side effects, but dry mouth, red eyes, and paranoia are usually among the most common. Despite its strength, R-18 remains obscure almost everywhere, though it's probably most popular in the American West."

Royal Queen Strain,"Most queens know their lineage, but Royal Queen's is a mystery. So is the exact balance of sativa and indica in this moderately potent medical choice. It's also unclear whether this strain got its name from the Dutch seed bank or because it has some relation to Space Queen; either is possible. In any event, Royal Queen is a good choice for alleviating the symptoms of anxiety, chronic pain, and sleeplessness. The high is mostly physical, which suggest indica dominance, but also brings limited cerebral effects. The experience is deeply relaxed and sleepy. THC levels are reputed to be very high in this strain, greater than 23% in at least one test. CBD numbers, on the other hand, are hard to peg, but that alone suggests Royal Queen may not be an ideal choice for patients suffering from epilepsy or other conditions that respond to that chemical. There isn't much information available about the flavor or aroma of this strain or, for that matter, its appearance. But it's known to be relatively light on side effects, especially paranoia. Don't look too hard for Royal Queen; you probably won't find it, as it's a rarity pretty much everywhere."

Anxiety, depression, insomnia, migraines, and other headaches are among the best medical uses for Grapefruit Haze. But given the relative paucity of CBD, which makes up slightly less than 1%, this strain shouldn't be the first choice for treating seizures and other problems that are alleviated with CBD. Be prepared for the usual adverse effects, such as dry mouth and dry eyes, dizziness, anxiety, and limited paranoia. The flavor and smell of this strain are fruity with hints of spice, and the bud is green with orange hairs. Though not especially popular, Grapefruit Haze can be found along the West Coast from Los Angeles to British Columbia, and also in Arizona."
Hindu Skunk Strain,"Hindu Skunk is a hybrid with a 30:70 sativa/indica ratio. It is basically a cross between Skunk #1 and Hindu Kush, which explains why it creates an amazing 22% THC level that will keep you coming back for more. The buds are green in color and covered by trichomes with a tan hue. Even though it has a skunky smell to it, it has a nice aroma with a hint of fruit. As for the taste, it is exquisite and smooth during the inhale. It tastes fruity and is quite potent with heavy smoke while you exhale. Hindu Skunk is perfect for first time users. The high will not send you through the roof, but in fact is quite relaxing. The strain is a good body and cerebral mix and is perfect for day time use. However, it is ill advised to smoke it before you sleep. Not only will you feel restless but you will feel hungry at the same time. The strain can be used by individuals suffering from anorexia or eating disorders. But that is not all, as it is just as effective at relieving stress and anxiety which makes it a useful strain with very few drawbacks."
Karma Bitch Strain,"Karma Bitch is an evenly balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain created through crossing the powerful Skywalker OG with the head-spinning Nevil’s Wreck. This combination results in a heady high that will really have you thinking that karma might just actually be a bitch. You’ll feel a rush of euphoria at first toke, lifting your spirits and leaving you feeling focused with a sense of creative inspiration. Before you know it, this vibrancy will be snatched from you, resulting in a sedated state both mentally and physically that leaves you wandering what you could have accomplished before it kicked in. Eventually, this full-bodied effect can knock you straight into the dream-zone, spinning you off into deep and dream-infested sleep for hours. With its high THC level that bottoms out at around 18-20% and crazy effects, Karma Bitch is well-suited for treating nausea, mood swings, insomnia, and depression. It has a sweet yet spicy coffee flavor with notes of herbal tea on each harsh exhale. The aroma is very peppery and woody, with a pungent coffee overtone that’s slightly sour at times. Karma Bitch buds have tight small dark olive green nugs with purple undertones and fiery orange hairs."
Joker’s Grin Strain,"This homage to Batman's least favorite psychopath is a blend of Vortex, a sativa from TGA Genetics, and the legendary OG Kush. The exact sativa/indica ratio of Joker's Grin is something of a mystery, though its mostly physical effects suggest the indica genes may be dominant. The THC and CBD levels in this strain are likewise hard to come by. The lack of information on CBD, however, suggests that CBD isn't plentiful enough to recommend this strain for treatment of seizures and other conditions that require the cannabinoid. But Joker's Grin delivers a calming physical buzz that can be very effective at treating bodily pain. It may also be useful as a treatment for anxiety and mood problems. The nugs are chunky and dense, with a visible layer of trichome crystals. The smell and taste are both distinctly sweet and fruity. The usual negative effects – dry mouth and red eyes – are likely, along with possible paranoia. Like TGA's Vortex, Joker's Grin is probably easiest to find in California, Michigan, Oregon, and Washington State, as well as Canada and Europe. But it's likely quite rare even in these places."
Hawaiian Punch Strain,"The origins of this Hawaiian original are murky: It's known to be a potent native of the islands, but its exact genetics, including the ratio of sativa to indica, are a mystery. THC levels reportedly can top 21%, making this an especially powerful medical option. CBD contents, on the other hand, aren't widely known, so Hawaiian Punch isn't recommended as the only form of treatment for seizure disorders. But it is known to be an effective mediation for anxiety, pain, migraine headaches, stress, depression, and mood disorders. The high is said to be intensely euphoric and happy, with a strong dose of creativity a clear-headed outlook. Paranoia and cottonmouth are the adverse effects most commonly reported by users of Hawaiian Punch, though dry eyes, dizziness, and headaches are also possible. This strain has a smooth, sweet flavor with hints of the tropics and pineapples. The aroma has spicy notes. The nugs are dense and forest green, with a dense frosting of resinous trichomes. Outside its home state, Hawaiian Punch is most popular on the West Coast of the United States and Canada."
Iron Triangle Strain,"Iron Triangle is a rare evenly balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain created as an OG and Kush descendant, although its exact parentage is unknown. This bud brings on the heavy-hitting high with a 25% average THC level and heady effects that leave you with heavy red eyes and a sleepy disposition. The high starts with a creative boost of happy focus and deep mental relaxation. Eventually this sense of focus and energy will morph and become stoney and sedative, leaving your mind hazy and unfocused and completely pain-free. This sleepy state will slowly drip throughout the rest of your body, leaving you insanely tired and still slightly stoney. Thanks to these effects and its high THC level, Iron Triangle is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as headaches or migraines, glaucoma, depression and chronic pain. Iron Triangle buds have tight conical-shaped forest green nugs with dark orange pistils and a coating of golden amber crystal trichomes. As each nug is broken apart, rich diesel smells are released accented by citrusy herbs and spices. The flavor is sweet and citrusy with a lemon herbal overtone that’s incredibly tangy."
Double Dream Strain,"Double Dream is a sativa dominant hybrid strain with a 10:90 indica/sativa ratio and is quite popular amongst the cannabis community. The strain is produced by crossing Dream Star and Blue Dream. Upon closer inspection, you will realize each bud is incredibly dense and light green in color. The nuggets are mostly covered with brown hairs with an adequate amount of trichomes. Double Dream is a treat nonetheless with a floral scent that will keep you coming back for more. As for the flavor, it is far more complex. The strain offers a perfect blend of spicy, sweet and berry flavors, which is quite rare to come across in a sativa strain, such as this. As soon as you smoke the strain, you will feel the high set in at the back of your head. From thereon in, the high makes its way throughout the rest of your body. The effects are rather calming and will energize you in no time. You do not have to worry about being knocked out by the strain. It allows you to keep a clear head and is actually perfect for daytime use. That being said, the strain is also perfect for treating medical conditions like pain, anxiety, inflammation and headaches as well."

Like Grand Daddy Purple, this bud has dark and lumpy dense purple colored nugs with dark amber hairs, purple leaves, and a frosty thick coating of crystal clear trichomes. The flavor pays tribute to its grandfather strain as well, with a taste of smooth dank berries accented by a sweet spicy aftertaste. The aroma is very mellow, with berries and grapes accented by a touch of dank and spice. Deepwater Purps has a classic indica high that affects both mind and body, leaving you utterly relaxed for hours on end. It starts with a hazy euphoric head rush that lifts your spirits without agitating anxiety or giving you any sense of frenzied energy. This is accompanied by a building body buzz that can be felt through you very fingertips, leaving you completely pain free and relaxed with a slight sense of couch-lock that isn’t overwhelming.

It delivers a perfect blend of musky and dark chocolate flavors which most cannabis users will come to love and enjoy. DC OG burns slow and hot and its effects can be felt almost instantaneously. You will feel the high from the back of your eyes. After a minute or so it tends to make its way through the rest of your body. DC OG is not a force to be reckoned with. It is quite potent and is not suitable for individuals who are new to smoking cannabis. Experienced users may feel energized but consuming too much of the strain can cause them to feel confused and lazy at the same time. That being said, the strain does have other advantages as well.

This tasty bud brings on the amazing flavors, mixing fresh nutty mint with ripe blueberries for a confusingly delicious taste that will dance across your tongue.

It has a fruity berry aroma with a CBD level of 0.73 per cent and high levels of THC: 15-20%. It belongs to the Indica variety of strains and is farmed in the UK. Cheese is a useful pain reliever and calming agent that also help in overcoming chronic symptoms of extreme depression, body aches and anxiety disorders. It is important to note that this specific strain may prove a little too heavy for beginners, causing throbbing headaches, head spins and even anxiety attacks. Still, these symptoms are not particularly harmful; they are common in the initial period of intake. They may experience its positive effects immediately after the initial symptoms wear off, which takes a few hours at most. Although this medical marijuana strain may prove to be too much for beginners, it significantly helps in rationally placing its medical benefits and special effects into the limelight of a favorable environment."
Key Lime Pie Strain,"Key Lime Pie is just as tasty as it sounds! This indica dominant hybrid (75% indica/25% sativa) strain is a phenotype of the ever-popular Girl Scout Cookies strain and boasts a moderate THC level f 19-22%. Smoking Key Lime Pie will give you an intense onset of feeling stoned followed by a mellow, lucid high with cerebral clarity.

With a minty, candy-like taste with a smoky lime aftertaste and a chocolate cream scent, Key Lime Pie may seem to he ideal for novice users.

Jesus OG Strain,"Jesus OG is a sativa dominant hybrid with a 20:80 indica/ sativa ratio. It is a cross between Jack's Cleaner, Hell's OG and Space Queen. The nuggets are dense light green buds, which are completely covered by trichomes. Its smell is quite different from what you would normally expect, and is similar to the aroma of floor cleaners and freshly turned soil. But then again, its taste is quite extraordinary. It is slightly spicy and earthy and tingles in the throat and nose as you exhale. The high is quite similar to how you would feel if someone punched you in the face, or maybe not. But you will feel something quite similar to say the least. You will experience a body and head rush that is mostly followed by confused thoughts and paralyzing spaciness. Additionally, you will feel energetic, which may feel strange at first, but it will last for quite some time. Its heavy effects will eventually relax your body and mind. You will also be able to function much more effectively and will feel clear headed, which is something to look forward to.

Infinite Euphoria Strain,Infinite Euphoria is a super rare even balanced hybrid (50% indica/50% sativa) strain created through crossing the potent
Lavender Kush Strain,"The Lavender Kush is one strain that is known to have been made using a combination of various strains from all over the world. This includes strains such as Soma Seeds, the Super Skunk, Big Skunk Korean and the Afghani Hawaiian. The strain has many dense buds that have a very spicy yet a very flowery smell. The purple color of the leaves makes its appearance stand out from the rest of the strain leaves. This strain is good for you if you are too stressed out or anxious most of the time. This strain helps you get rid of stress and helps you get a good night's sleep. It makes you happy and lifts up your mood. The strain makes you feel euphoric and lazy.

Kryptonite Strain,"Superman himself would have a hard time handling this massively potent indica-dominant strain, which has an 15:85 sativa/indica ratio. With THC content as high as 25%, Kryptonite packs a major euphoric punch. It's best for anxiety, but also good for depression and insomnia. Kryptonite has a sweet but pungent earthy smell and a similar flavor. Dry mouth is common, as are red eyes, but most other adverse effects are limited. Kryptonite is most popular in legal markets in the West and Southwest United States, less so elsewhere. It scores well with patients, though it isn't easily found in many places. This strain creates a powerful, long-lasting couch-lock that eases pain and stress. Don't let the name fool you: Kryptonite is strong, but it's highly effective as medication, as long as it's used to treat the right symptoms. Likely a blend of Killer Queen and Mendocino Purps, both hybrids, Kryptonite also has a touch of the infamously potent G-13 in its lineage. Legend says that super strain was smuggled out of the federal government's only pot farm back in the 60s. It's probably just myth, but anything with G-13 in it is bound to pack a major wallop."
Kosher Kush Strain,"Kosher Kush is famous for its enticing flavor and high potency ingredients. But that's not the only thing that makes this strain famous; Kosher Kush is the only strain that has been blessed by a Rabbi!

The most commonly reported side effects include headache, dry eyes and dizziness. However, heavy smokers might not experience the same kinds of effects as the beginners. It is recommended to practice extreme caution with the strain; high amounts of Kosher Kush can cause blurred vision and lack of clarity."

Popcorn Kush Strain,"Though its appearance is similar to popcorn, this strain shouldn't be confused for the low-quality ""popcorn"" nugs produced by many marijuana plants. They may be small, but they pack a punch. Popcorn Kush is an indica-dominant hybrid, but the precise ratio of sativa to indica is unclear. This strain has relatively high THC levels, over 17% in some tests. On the other hand, CBD levels are too low to register, meaning Popcorn Kush shouldn't be relied upon as the only treatment for seizures or other problems that respond to that chemical. The flavor is similar to buttered popcorn, with additional notes of grapefruit, blue cheese, and blueberries. The smell, meanwhile, includes sweet hints of berries, cheese, and fruit. The popcorn-shaped nugs are bright green with light green leaves, brown hairs, and crystals. The effects – calming, creative, and happy – are good for treating anxiety, glaucoma, ADHD, and chronic pain, while an intense case of the munchies makes Popcorn Kush an ideal medication for eating and wasting disorders. Likely side effects include dry eyes and cottonmouth, while paranoia, headaches, and dizziness are also reported. Though not especially popular, this strain can be found on the medical marijuana markets of Washington State and California."
God's Bubba Strain,"God’s Bubba is a super powerful indica dominant hybrid strain created through combining the heavy-hitting God Bud and Pre-98 Bubba Kush strains. With THC levels that typically tip the scales at about 25% and a heavy full-bodied high, God’s Bubba is truly a gift from above! The high comes on hard like a punch to the brain with an almost immediate euphoric lift that immediately diffuses any racing thoughts or mental pains. This sense of complete happiness will start to fade in and out of focus, leaving you easily distracted and out of it mentally. A subtle tingle will slowly start to build in the back of your head before spreading through the rest of your body with warming tendrils, leaving you with a buzzy body high that’s completely relaxing and sedative. This effect can lead many users to fall asleep, especially those who aren’t as experienced with medical cannabis. These potent effects and its high THC level give God’s Bubba the ability to treat conditions such as chronic pain, insomnia, headaches, and appetite loss. God’s Bubba has a classic kush flavor and aroma with hints of dank spicy herbs and earthy pine.

Red Dragon Strain,"Living up to its name, Red Dragon is an exotic Asian flower that crosses Himalayan Kush with Utopian Haze. The sativa genes are dominant in this hybrid, which has a sativa/indica ratio of between 60:40 and 70:30. THC levels, which top 16% in available tests, are high enough to deliver effective medical treatment yet low enough to appeal to first-time patients and occasional smokers. Even so, the side effects from this strain can be powerful, especially the paranoia, so patients with anxiety may want to avoid this strain. Still, it's an excellent tool for relieving depression, inflammation, migraine headaches, mood disorders, nausea, pain, and insomnia. It's a less helpful tool in fighting seizures and other conditions that require CBD, since that chemical is scarce in Red Dragon. The high the strain produces is euphoric and happy yet sleepy and powerfully hungry, making it a good tool for alleviating wasting and eating disorders. The smell is spicy yet sweet and woody, while the flavor is similar. In addition to widely reported paranoia and anxiety, dry mouth, dry eyes, and dizziness are also possible side effects."
Pink Lady Strain,"Pink lady (sometimes also known as pink kush) is an A grade sativa dominant strain. Pink lady, although relatively expensive in the cannabis world, provides a cerebral high that is similar to that obtained by the OG Kush. Some report the sativa/indica ratio to be near 60:40 while both slightly higher and lower readings have been measured. The effects of this particular strain have been defined by some as a very pro-active one. What this means is that when smoked, the smoker will feel relatively more active and alive. This is perhaps one of the reasons why this strain is used by people suffering from ADD. People with chronic pains such as arthritis have also been known to use this. The aroma of this strain is very pleasing. It gives off that piney smell closely related to the type you get from car air fresheners. In terms of taste, it is anything but piney. Mostly fruity with major undertones of grapefruit. The smoke feels very, very smooth both on inhale and on exhale and is fast to act. The appearance of the pink lady is nothing special; it is a dull color of green with very few orange and white hairs."

Due to its calming effects, this marijuana strain is perfect for curing stress, anxiety and depression of all kinds. It soothes away nervousness and terrible headaches. Despite its beneficial effects, it has two prominent side-effects: dry mouth and eyes."
Candy Jack Strain,"Candy Jack is the super-potent end result of a crossbreed between the famed sativa Jack Herer and the sativa-dominant Cotton Candy. This Cannabis Cup winner has THC levels that can hit 27%, making it easily one of the strongest strains in the world. CBD content, on the other hand, is low, less than 1%. The sativa genes dominate in Candy Jack, as they do in its parent strains (the exact ratio of sativa to indica in Candy Jack is unknown). That means a strong, peppy, energetic cerebral high with creativity and a shot of euphoria. Expect sharp mental focus while using this medical strain. The aroma is earthy while the flavor is sweet with hints of citrus. The best applications for this medicine include anxiety, depression, asthma, spinal cord injury, migraines, and chronic pain, as well as headaches.

The OG Smalls buds have medium-sized dark olive green incredibly dense nugs that are narrow and have rich purple undertones with long thin deep amber and fiery orange hairs. These leafy nugs are caked in a layer of fine milky white trichomes and visible drops of syrupy sweet resin."
Kush Berry Strain,"Kush Berry is also popularly referred to as Berry Kush. It is a 100% indica dominant strain with THC content that offers a high that is quite powerful. Kush Berry is cross between OG Kush and Blueberry, it has large buds. With some more highlighted tones, the buds are dark green in color.

Cherry AK-47 Strain,"Cherry AK-47 obviously comes from storied parents: It's a phenotype of AK-47, a strain famed worldwide for its potency. The ""Cherry"" part of the name reflects its reddish-purple coloring and cherry aroma. THC levels can reach 16%, so Cherry AK-47 is moderately potent, while CBD concentration doesn't exceed 1%. That means this isn't a great choice for treating epilepsy. But it is helpful with lack of appetite, nausea, chronic pain, insomnia, and anxiety. As a sativa-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of at least 70:30), Cherry AK-47delivers both body and cerebral effects. The sensation is strongly euphoric and psychoactive. In addition to cherry, this strain smells of cream, sandalwood, mint, and rotten fruit, while it tastes of skunk. The bud is almost silver with shiny trichomes, growing on top of strands of green, brown, and gray. Cherry AK-47 can cause red eyes and dry mouth, while dizziness and paranoia are somewhat less likely.

It's less likely on the black market, but may circulate there as well."
Cranberry Kush Strain,"Cranberry Kush is an indica dominant hybrid (70% indica/30% sativa) strain created by breeders at the Cannabis Social Club Barcelona.

This bud is famous for its taste – citrus that lingers as you exhale and sweetens as you continue to smoke.

Patients describe the high as a mild onset indica high that calms and relaxes them with a mild head buzz, followed by a slowly creeping feeling of being bodily stoned that is intensely relaxing and euphoric.

Rose Kush Strain,"Rose Kush is the parent of several popular hybrids, but by itself it's anything but common. Indeed, the THC content alone, topping 21% in some tests, is enough to set this sativa-dominant strain apart. That chemical intensity means a potent head high with limited cerebral effects; it's clear-headed and energized, with a strong tingling sensation. This makes Rose Kush a good source of medication for migraine headaches, muscle spasms, physical pain, insomnia, and daily stress.

Rose Kush smells like diesel fuel, with floral, sweet, and skunky notes, while the flavor is herbal and woody. This strain is coated in a thick layer of crystal trichomes, a promise of the potency that lies within.

Chocolate OG Strain,"Chocolate OG, sometimes mistakenly referred to as Chocolope, is a pure-indica strain (sativa/indica ratio of 0:100) with unknown parentage, though presumably OG Kush is in the picture somewhere.

Big Sur Holy Weed Strain,"The genetics of this sativa-dominant hybrid (70:30 sativa/indica ratio) are obscure, but Big Sur Holy Weed is rumored to be a descendant of Zacatecas Purple, an original Mexican sativa, and Mazar i Sharif, itself a combination of Afghani and Skunk strains. THC test results are hard to come by for this medical strain, but its modest popularity and limited availability suggest it's moderately potent at best. That makes it a good choice for part-time smokers and newcomers. It can be an effective form of treatment for anxiety, low mood, chronic pain, and stress. But because there is little public data on CBD levels in Big Sur Holy Weed, it's not a good choice for patients with seizures or other conditions that require CBD. The rainbow bud of this strain has gold-tinted leaves and orange, red, and yellow hairs. It tastes like sweet licorice and spicy peppers, and it has a sweet, herbal melon aroma. There are few reports of side effects, but cottonmouth and dry eyes are safe bets. Despite its name, Big Sur Holy Wood sells better in Oregon than in California. But it doesn't sell terribly well anywhere."

The high is equal parts physical and mental, with a pleasant, lazy body buzz and sleepiness countered by cerebral effects that include euphoria and a peppy mood boost. This strain is an effective tool in treating low mood, anxiety, nausea, chronic pain, insomnia, and stress. It's also a good choice for alleviating eating disorders and wasting conditions, as it induces a powerful case of the munchies. THC levels are on the upper end of modest, at least 15% in publicly available tests, so the effects are certainly noticeable. But CBD levels are much lower, less than 1%, so Black Velvet shouldn't be used as an exclusive treatment for epilepsy or other conditions alleviated by CBD.

In other words, it's probably not a good choice as yet. But Blue Mystic is much more effective treatment for anxiety, depression, migraines and other headaches, chronic pain, and insomnia. The high is largely cerebral, with creative, euphoric effects, happiness, and a case of the giggles. That belies this strain's true indica-dominant nature (sativa/indica ratio of about 40:60). Northern Lights and Blueberry are the most likely parents of Blue Mystic, but there's no way to know for sure. This strain both tastes and smells like berries, especially blueberries, a sign of its Blueberry heritage. The buds are covered in thick layers of trichomes that hint at Blue Mystic's potency.

One thing is for certain: you will exhibit symptoms of couch-lock which is why you should not make any other plans after smoking Chem Diesel. The cannabis strain is extremely potent. A hit is more than enough to make you toasty. Its high will relax and calm you nonetheless and make you feel extremely hungry at the same time. That being said, it is also quite effective at treating severe medical conditions like anorexia, insomnia and chronic pains and aches."
Chem 4 OG Strain,"Chem 4 OG, also known as ""Chemdawg 4 OG"" to some users, is a indica dominant hybrid (60% indica/40% sativa) strain created by breeders at Cali Connection as a potent cross between the insanely popular Chemdawg 4 X"

Cherry Blossom Strain,"This sweet-tasting indica-dominant hybrid is most often found in the Pacific Northwest, where it sells on the medical markets in Oregon and Washington State. It may also be available in California, though it's less common elsewhere. It's not a staple on the black market, either, but may circulate there from time to time. Cherry Blossom is an indica-dominant hybrid with roughly a 30:70 sativa/indica ratio. Its genetics aren't widely known, so it's hard to say exactly what kind of crossbreed this is. It's a highly potent strain, with some sources claiming THC levels as high as 27%, though that's doubtful. CBD levels aren't reported but probably aren't very high. Cherry Blossom is best for treating anxiety, stress, and insomnia, as it delivers a powerful, mellow body high that calms and soothes sore muscles and jagged nerves. It should be saved for late nights, as the high can be sedating. This strain has a sweet cherry flavor to match its name and a sweet aroma. Negative effects are unclear, though like most strains, Cherry Blossom likely causes dry eyes and cottonmouth."
Bubblicious Strain,"Bubblicious is a hybrid with Indica dominancy. It is cross between Original Bubblegum Female and an F1 Lavender Male, where 70 per cent of it constitutes of Indica and 30 per cent of Sativa. This particular strain has a fruity flavour and similarly bubble gum aroma, hence its name. This strain is light green and has an icy look. It can be grown indoors and outdoors within the flowering period of eight to ten weeks. Bubblicious has a very high THC level, up to 20 per cent. It has a euphoric effect on the patient and helps in promoting relaxation and serenity. It is mostly used in stress-related disorders, headaches, nausea, anxiety-associated problems, and chronic pain. It induces excitement, calmness, happiness and may even lead to uncontrollable giggles. One disadvantage is that it may cause dehydration of the eyes and mouth. Bubblicious is regarded as the most popularly used medical marijuana strain, with the best composition and most favourable effects for patients. It is the most promising combination strain developed so far as it provides the best taste, smell, and result."
Blue Magoo Strain,The ancestry of this medical marijuana strain can be dated back to mid 90s when it was bred from

OG Strawberry Strain,"OG Strawberry, also often called “Strawberry Kush,” is an indica dominant hybrid (85% indica/15% sativa) strain created as a cross between the insanely popular Bruce Banner #3 and SFV OG strains. This powerful bud has posted a THC level of up to 28% and a CBD level that ranges from 1-2% on average. This bud has an aroma of sweet and sour strawberry diesel and a taste of sour diesel with a hint of sweet berry that intensifies upon each exhale. OG Strawberry buds have super dense small to medium-sized pebble-shaped forest green nugs with sparse fiery orange hairs and a frosty layer of thick chunky white trichomes and sweet sticky resin. The OG Strawberry high starts as a mildly uplifting euphoric effect and tingling felt behind the eyes and in the back of the head. This high slowly spreads throughout the body, leaving you lazy and hungry with a warming sensation that can leave you completely aroused. You’ll be talkative and insanely introspective on this bud, making it perfect for social situations. Because of these effects, OG Strawberry is often used to treat patients suffering from conditions such as insomnia, migraines or headaches, muscle spasms, and chronic anxiety."
Purple Skunk Strain,"A heavily sativa-dominant hybrid, Purple Skunk is a cross of the ever-popular Skunk #1 and an older, more obscure purps strain. The sativa/indica ratio is roughly 85:15, so expect creative cerebral effects with a strong dose of euphoria, a tingling sensation, and powerful hunger. That makes this a good strain for treating lack of appetite, though it's also effective with anxiety, depression, migraine headaches, chronic pain, insomnia, and daily stresses. Purple Skunk has relatively high THC content, topping at least 18% in tests, and that makes for potent psychoactive effects that may be too strong for newcomers and part-time tokers. CBD levels are likely quite low, given the abundance of THC, but since they're not widely reported, it's hard to know. For that reason alone, Purple Skunk shouldn't be used as a CBD strain for patients whose conditions require that chemical. This strain tastes of berry, earth, and Skunk, while it smells much the same. Reported side effects include watery eyes, cottonmouth, dizziness, headaches, and paranoia. Though popular among those who have tried it, Purple Skunk isn't widespread; it's easiest to find in Washington State, Oregon, Montana, Arizona, and California."
Purple Dream Strain,"Blue Dream, a potent even blend of sativa and indica, is one of the most popular marijuana strains of all time. So is Purple Kush, a mightily powerful pure indica (the ratio of sativa to indica is unknown). Together they were used to breed Purple Dream, a mild but effective indica-dominant hybrid. Some sources use this name to describe a different strain, a cross of Blue Dream and Granddaddy Purps, but the Purple Kush cross seems to be more popular. THC levels are apparently low, probably no more than 15-20%, but there's no available information on CBD contents. The taste and smell are both reminiscent of berries, flowers, and pine trees. The bud is dark green with many flecks of dark brown and a light dusting of trichomes. The high is cerebral and euphoric with a mood boost and a creative spark. Use Purple Dream to treat anxiety, mood disorders, depression, ADHD, inflammation, migraine headaches, and muscle spasms. Side effects may include bloodshot eyes and dry mouth, while dizziness, paranoia, and headaches are less likely. Look for this strain in California, Colorado, Washington State, and Arizona."
Purple Gorilla Strain,"The sativa/indica ratio of this sweet, fruity strain is roughly 40:60, making it a good choice for treating insomnia, pain, migraine headaches, and muscle spasms, among other problems. The exact heredity is something of a mystery, but it probably carries genes that descend from the original Mendocino Purps. Tests suggest this strain has THC content that can top 17%, possibly more, so it's typically quite potent. Unfortunately for patients with seizure disorders and other conditions that are treated with CBD, that cannabinoid appears in this strain in low concentration, less than 1%. The indica parentage sparks a creative, energized high in both the body and the head, together with intense euphoria and happiness. Medical uses include treatment for anxiety, muscle spasms, migraine headaches, nausea, chronic pain, and insomnia. This strain produces a sharp, pungent aroma of earth and berries, together with a similar flavor. Nugs are relatively dark with many amber strands. The medical market in Arizona is the easiest place to find this effective strain, though it's also sold in at least one Oregon dispensary and occasionally makes the rounds on the black market."
Qrazy Train Strain,"Trainwreck, Trinity, Purple Urkle, and Space Queen were combined to form Qrazy Train, a popular hybrid with a near-even blend of sativa and indica (roughly a 50:50 sativa/indica ratio). Maximum THC levels hover below 16%, so while this strain isn't particularly potent, it's a good choice for patients who are just starting with medical marijuana. But it's not a great selection for those who suffer from seizure disorders or other conditions that can typically be treated with CBD, as that cannabinoid is almost completely absent from Qrazy Train, less than 1%. This strain is an effective pain reliever, and it's also helpful with anxiety, sleeplessness, and depressed mood. The effects are euphoric, happy, and uplifting, and the high may induce laziness and sleep. Dry mouth and dry eyes are almost equally common when smoking Qrazy Train, while dizziness is also reported. Paranoia and headaches are less common. This strain has a fruity smell, with flavors that range from blueberries and melons to Skunk and spice. It has a light, multi-colored appearance, with a light dusting of trichomes on the bud. The Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Michigan, and Montana are the most likely places to find this accessible option."
Malawi Gold Strain,"Malawi Gold is a 100% pure sativa strain native to the region of Malawi in Africa that is a favorite of breeders and users alike. This classic bud offers a moderate THC level between 9-13% and a mild aroma of banana, as it is traditionally cured wrapped in layers of banana leaves. Malawi Gold is prized among cannabis users for its uplifting clear-headed high that won’t weight you down or leave you feeling anxious or paranoid. This high hits you fast with a crashing wave of cerebral energy that leaves you laser-focused with a sense of motivation and purpose. Because of its moderate THC level, the cerebral effects are not too overpowering and are perfect for any level of cannabis user. Because of these cerebral sativa effects, Malawi Gold is often a choice for treating fatigue, mild cases of depression, chronic stress, and nausea. This bud has pyramid-shaped bright neon green super leafy nugs with red hairs and frosty amber hued trichomes and sweet sticky resin. Malawi Gold has a classic sativa aroma of sweet and spicy fresh herbs with just a hint of banana and an enticing taste of sweet and spicy herbal tea with just a touch of earth upon exhale."

Six Shooter Strain,"Six Shooter is an evenly balanced hybrid strain (50% indica/50% sativa) created through a potent five-way cross of the infamous Haze X Super Skunk X Northern Lights X Brazilian Royal Dutch X Trainwreck strains. Named for its crazy combination of celebrity strains, Six Shooter brings on a heavy-hitting high that will have you soaring mere moments after your first toke. You’ll feel a euphoric onset at the start of the high accompanied by a tingly sense of cerebral euphoria. This buzziness stimulates the mind, providing a sense of creativity and motivation alongside a building happiness that seems to grow and grow without any ceiling. Thanks to these potent effects and its high 20-25% average THC level, Six Shooter is often recommended for treating those suffering from chronic anxiety or stress, nausea or appetite loss, chronic pain, depression and headaches or migraines. This bud has a super sweet citrusy lemon flavor with a lightly spicy herbal haze exhale. The aroma follows the same pattern, although with hints of pungent skunk and earth to it at times. Six Shooter bud shave flat oversized dark olive green nugs with lots of thin red-orange hairs and a frosty thick coating of beautiful tiny white crystal trichomes."
Orange Turbo Strain,Orange Turbo is a sativa dominant hybrid strain created as a cross of the infamous
Romulan Grapefruit Strain,"This is a hybrid descendant of the popular strains Romulan and Grapefruit. They combine to create a strong indica (sativa/indica ratio unknown) with both mental and physical effects. CBD contents in Romulan Grapefruit are relatively small, probably less than 2%. That means this strain shouldn't be used alone to relieve seizure disorders or other conditions that require CBD treatment. But it can be used effectively as medicine for a wide range of other health problems, such as anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, lack of appetite, nausea, chronic pain, insomnia, and everyday stress. The high is calming and focused, with a mood boost, increased sociability, and physical relaxation, as well as a strong case of the munchies. THC levels are above average, measuring at least 16% in available tests. In other words, this is a good choice for patients looking to cross over from the weaker beginner strains into more potent territory. Dry mouth and paranoia are the most common side effects, though dizziness, red eyes, and headaches are also reported. Romulan Grapefruit, not surprisingly, has a strong aroma and flavor of grapefruit, together with cheese and apples. This strain sells well in California and Oregon but is more scarce elsewhere."

Pineapple Trainwreck Strain,"Pineapple Trainwreck is a cross between Shipwreck and Pineapple Express. It is a sativa dominant strain with a 20:80 indica/sativa ratio. By the looks of the strain, it will not look like much, but looks can be deceiving nonetheless. The buds are dense and a bit spongy with a shaggy trim. There are no stand-out features apart from the size itself. As for the smell, you can expect the same great spicy-sour-citrus aroma. However, you will immediately realize that the scent has hints of old tropical fruit as well. All in all, the scent is unique and quite pleasant. Even though Pineapple Express has never managed to impress or live up to its name, Pineapple Trainwreck proves to be exceed expectations. The strain is extremely sweet and cool with an easy non-expansive smoke which is quite rare to come across. The strain has a nice high and will leave your relaxed in a number of minutes. The buzz will energize you making you feel refreshed. You may even get the munchies, which is why it would be a good idea to have some snacks lying around while you smoke the strain. It is the perfect solution to your wake-n-bake problems, which is why it is recommended for daytime use. Furthermore, due to its characteristics, the strain is also referred to patients suffering from stress, anorexia and chronic pains and aches as well."

Orange Diesel Strain,"Orange Diesel, also known as “Sour Orange Diesel,” is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid (60% sativa/40% indica) strain created as a cross between the potent"
Outdoor Snow Cap Strain,"Outdoor Snow Cap is the close cousin of Snowcap, a sativa-heavy hybrid that's increasingly popular in the American West. Presumably the ""outdoor"" label means this particular strain is recommended for outdoor cultivation. Outdoor Show Cap is loaded with THC: That cannabinoid makes up as much as 23% of this strain in some tests. CBD levels, though, are very low, less than 1%, which means this strain isn't ideal for treating seizure disorders or other diseases that respond to CBD. The sativa genes dominate in this descendant of an unknown Haze plant, while the limited indica heredity has little effect. The exact sativa/indica ratio, however, is unknown. The high is powerful and head-focused, with creative, clear-headed thinking, energy enhancement, potent euphoria, and a happy case of the giggles. That makes Outdoor Snow Cap best for treating anxiety, depression, fatigue, ADHD, inflammation, mood disorders, and chronic pain. Expect the usual side effects: dry mouth, red eyes, and possibly some paranoia. This strain has a strong, pungent chemical odor similar to ammonia, while it has a distinct lemon flavor. Look for Outdoor Snow Cap at dispensaries on the West Coast and in Montana, Arizona, and Colorado."
Pink Starburst Strain,Pink Starburst is a sativa dominant hybrid strain created through a potent cross of the delicious (
Platinum Purple Kush Strain,"This heavy, sleepy indica is an ideal nighttime strain and can help treat insomnia. It provides deep body relaxation while maintaining mental focus. The effects are calming, euphoric, and happy, and come with a powerful case of the munchies. This makes it ideal for lack of appetite, as well as anxiety, migraines, headaches, inflammation, muscle spasms, chronic pain, and stress. THC levels are nothing to write home about, hovering around 23% in most available tests. Nor is there much CBD in this strain: less than 1%, and that makes this a less than ideal tool in dealing with seizures or other disorders that require that cannabinoid. Still, it can be a very pleasant choice for patients who have never used marijuana before or who want a mellow, calming experience. Berry, earth, and grape are the dominant notes to the smell and taste of Platinum Purple Kush, while the nugs are large and leafy, light green, and purple with a platinum coating. Anxiety and dry mouth are widely reported side effects, but dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia are also possible. The easiest places to find this strain include California, Nevada, and the Pacific Northwest."

Mango Kush Strain,"Mangos and marijuana go together. The fruit is known to enhance the high for many people, and some cannabis strains are bred to evoke the fruit. The taste of Mango Kush, not surprisingly, is similar to mangos and Kush, with notes of pine. It smells of the tropics, sweet mangos, and bananas. THC can make up as much as 16% of this strain, while CBD is much lower, about 0.3%. That makes this a poor choice for treating conditions that respond to CBD, such as severe seizure disorders. Mango Kush is an indica-dominant hybrid (35:65 sativa/indica ratio) that can be used to treat nausea and vomiting, pain, insomnia, lack of appetite, and depression. The high is centered on the body, with deep relaxation, strong euphoria, and a general sedated feeling. Many patients find themselves talking and giggling more than usual while high on this strain.

While it's most popular on the West Coast, Mango Kush can also be found on the legal medical markets in Arizona and Michigan."
Lemon Thai Kush Strain,"Lemon Thai Kush is probably better known as simply Lemon Thai; real stoners tend to drop the formal ""Kush."" But the full name indicates just how strong this plant's genes are. This strain likely can trace its ancestry back to the Kush Mountains of Afghanistan by way of Lemon Kush, and also to an original Thai landrace sativa. No one seems to know the exact parentage of Lemon Thai Kush, but the result is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an unclear ratio of sativa to indica. This strain has a sweet lemony taste and an aroma of citrus fruit. The buds are long and have a bright green appearance. The THC and CBD contents are likewise mostly a mystery, at least outside the circles that grow and sell Lemon Thai. Expect a powerfully uplifting head high with euphoria and happiness. The effects are energizing and can spark creativity. Use it to treat anxiety and depression, as well as migraines and body pains. Many patients experience dry mouth and red eyes, while dizziness is also a possibility. Lemon Thai, though popular among those who have smoked it, isn't very common in the United States.

This indica-dominant hybrid has a sativa/indica ratio of 25/75, and that is reflected in the mostly physical high. The powerful effects include a calming body buzz with couch-lock, euphoria, happiness, and intense sleepiness. This makes Platinum OG a good medication for insomnia, as well as anxiety, low mood, ADHD, inflammation, migraine headaches, mood swings, and muscle spasms. CBD levels are very low, less than 1%, which isn't surprising, considering the high THC content. In other words, this strain shouldn't be used as sole treatment for seizures or other disorders that require CBD. Platinum OG produces a smell of diesel, spice, and coffee; the flavor is similar, with additional hints of herb. The bud is lime green and covered in fuzzy trichome hairs. Dry mouth is by far the most commonly cited side effect with this strain, though dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia are also reported. It sells best on the West Coast, in Colorado, and in Arizona."

As for the taste and smell, it is almost the same and isn't as extraordinary as you would expect it to be but it does not burn your lungs, unlike other strains. The strain and its effects kick in instantly. You will feel euphoric and extremely happy. Its effects are psychoactive and it does not offer much of a body buzz but it is enough to relax you.

Trainwreck #2 Strain,"The trainwreck #2 is an A grade potent sativa hybrid. Although the exact combination of strains that resulted in this is not known, it is speculated that this strain is the result of crossing OG Kush and Neville's Wreck. The sativa/indica ratio for this is near 80:20. This makes the trainwreck #2 an extremely potent smoke with a THC level nearing 22%. Like many other sativa strains, this one has similar medicinal uses. Besides using it as anxiety/pain medication, it is also prescribed to people with suffering from ADD and/or PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). When inhaled, the smoker feels an instant buzz followed by an overwhelming surge of euphoria boosting attentiveness, creativity and happiness. The smell of this strain is rather unique. It is hard to put a finger on what it is but the most accurate guess would be a mix of pine and flowers. The taste is similar. It is sweet and sour with a piney undertone that even leaves an aftertaste. Physically the strain is very dense which gives it a moist look. It is generally dark swampy green with lots of crystallization."
Skunk #1 Strain,"Skunk #1, also known as “#1” or simply as “Skunk,"" actually has less THC than its reputation might suggest: about 15-19% tops.

The result became a staple in itself and spawned countless hybrids containing its genes. True to its name, Skunk #1 smells decidedly skunky, while the taste is a mix of sour and earthy flavors. This is an indica-dominant strain (35:65 sativa/indica ratio) best used late in the day. Though it comes with a head buzz that belies its indica genes, Skunk #1 also provides deep-body relaxation. The head high is energetic and creative, while the body high is peaceful and soothing. It can be used to treat anxiety and other mental disorders, as well as chronic pain, headaches, and lack of appetite. This strain remains highly popular in Amsterdam, and though it can be found across the United States, it's mostly found on the West Coast, Arizona, and Colorado.

The high hits almost immediately after toking, what seems like mere seconds later, taking many users completely off guard as it rams into them with a euphoric head rush. They’ll feel instantly relieved of any negative mood or racing thoughts and instead be blissfully happy. Many users experience a high level of creative energy that inspires them artistically with a sense of focus and motivation. As the head high builds and builds, a mildly relaxing body buzz will crawl over you, leaving you physically pain free and anchored to the world as your mind soars. However, the Super Snow Dog high can prove to be too much for some users, and is not recommended for those who suffer from anxiety. These effects make Super Snow Dog the perfect bud for treating conditions such as mild to moderate cases of depression, chronic stress, nausea, appetite loss, and chronic fatigue. This bud has huge dense oversized yet tight spade-shaped dark forest green nugs with sparse amber hairs and a thick frosty coating of crystal white trichomes, almost like a snowy peak. Super Snow Dog packs a powerful smell, with a harsh pungency of herbal pine and sharp orange. The flavor is more likeable, with a sweet earthy pine taste that’s accented delicately by a citrus pungency upon exhale."
Trinity Strain,"Trinity is a sativa-dominant hybrid (sativa/indica ratio of 75:25) that has a devoted following despite its rarity. This strain's family history remains something of a mystery, though it apparently resulted from the crossing of several sativa strains out of Northern California. With THC levels that can reach 20%, Trinity delivers a potent head high that can clear away the blues and spur creativity. The euphoric effects are deeply relaxing and upbeat. CBD levels, meanwhile, are uncertain but probably quite low. In other words, Trinity is not a leading choice for conditions that respond to CBD. This strain is especially useful in treating depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as chronic pain and migraines. The limited indica genes also make this a strong option for treating insomnia. Dry mouth is a common adverse effect, as are red eyes, while anxiety and paranoia are also reported. The flavor and aroma are predominantly skunky, with sweet, pungent undertones. Trinity is most often found in Colorado and the Pacific Northwest, but even there it's scarce. Its sativa genetics and relative potency make it a highly sought-after strain, even in places where it's hard to find."

It is powerful enough to knock you out for good if you are not careful. Godfather OG is largely recommended for patients suffering from severe medical conditions, including insomnia, anxiety, depression, chronic pains and aches along with other mood disorders."
Sugar Cookie Strain,"Sugar cookie possesses an aromatic sweetness and is an indica dominant hybrid which allows a person to feel relaxed and at ease. The sweetness in the smell of the strain is the most likely source that could have inspired the name Sugar Cookie. It does not belong to the same family as the Girl Scout Cookie, as many people seem to believe. Its composition and basic structure are entirely different. Actually, the Sugar Cookie is a very famous three ways cross between the Sensei Star, Crystal Gale and Blue Hawaiian. It contains berry, tropical fruit and other similar flavors.

It has an exceptional flavor that most people relish and enjoy, but it tastes quite similar to Granddaddy Purple but with lemon after-tones and a hint of fresh citrus. Additionally, it has a strong aroma like that of berries. Even though it should be extremely purple, it is actually covered by gleaming white crystals and is quite dense. Considering its blend, it offers a high unlike any other. After smoking it, you will be left in a dreamy and peaceful daze. Do not be surprised if you want to end up hugging onto your couch for dear life before the high gradually begins to disappear. A few hits of the strain are more than enough to make you sleep for hours. But this is not necessarily a bad thing as it is perfect for individuals looking for a pain reliever. Moreover, it is highly effective as a stress reliever and at naturally boosting your appetite."

This strain has a fairly high CBD content, roughly 0.5%, but that's not high enough to recommend it as a front-line form of treatment for seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD preparations. Instead, Dream Queen can be used as an effective treatment for fatigue, nausea, stress, and lack of appetite (it induces powerful munchies). There are earthy notes of sage and tar to the flavor, while the aroma is earthy and rubbery. The nugs are light green and amber with a glistening coat of trichomes. Watery eyes and cottonmouth are both widely reported with this strain, while dizziness and paranoia are possible but much less likely.

sour headband Strain,Sour Headband is a sativa dominant hybrid (75% sativa/25% indica) strain created through crossing the infamous
Sour Kush Strain,"With a sativa/indica ratio of 30:70, Sour Kush is a hybrid in the truest sense of the word, delivering a combination of heady sativa effects and physical indica effects. The experience is happy, giggly, and euphoric yet lazy and relaxed. Creativity is also common while high on this strain. Sour Kush is reportedly very potent, but it's hard to come by any credible data to back that claim. Still, users describe a strong mental and physical high good for treating depression, pain, insomnia, stress, and lack of appetite. Sour Kush is especially good at treating chronic pain. But available information suggests CBD content is very low, too low to recommend this strain as a source of treatment for seizures or other problems that can be relieved with CBD preparations.

Following in the footsteps of its sativa Diesel heritage, Sour Dream produces an extremely happy, euphoric head high perfect for daylight errands and evening social occasions. The effects are creative and energetic, offset by possible dry mouth and red eyes. Other negatives include dizziness and paranoia. Effective medical uses for this strain include everyday stress, chronic pain, anxiety, and lack of appetite. It can also be helpful in treating insomnia, despite its upbeat effects. Like its Diesel parent, Sour Dream has a pungent, diesel aroma and flavor, with additional berry notes. The appearance of the bud is lime green with brown hairs. The exact sativa/indica hybrid of this strain isn't widely known. THC levels are reported to top 17%, making this a relatively potent medical choice. But CBD concentration is much lower, much too low to use Sour Dream as the only treatment for seizures. This strain can sometimes be found on the black market, but it's most popular on the legal markets of the West Coast, the Southwest, and the East Coast."

Chunky Diesel Strain,"Take Deep Chunk, an original Afghani indica, cross it with the sativa classic, and you get Chunky Diesel, a sativa-dominant hybrid with a clear head high that's perfect for daytime chores. The exact ratio of sativa to indica in this strain is unknown, and the same goes for THC and CBD content. Indeed, it's hard to learn much of anything about this decided rarity. But it's probably best used for mood disorders and anxiety. It's not especially recommended for its CBD content, so it doesn't work well on seizure disorders or other conditions that respond to CBD. On the other hand, the THC seems to be plentiful enough to make this an effective medical strain for some patients. Chunky Diesel has a chocolate flavor, with hints of its diesel origins present in both the taste and aroma. The bud is bright and dark green, with strands of brown and a thin, frosty layer of trichomes. The high is clear and focused, energetic and happy.

Patients should expect typical side effects, most commonly dry mouth and dry eyes, though dizziness and paranoia are also reported.

The high it produces is mostly physical, with deeply calming effects and sleepiness balanced with euphoria, mental focus, and a shot of creativity. This strain is said to be relatively potent, but that claim is hard to verify, as there is little public information on THC test results. The same is true of CBD levels, and that alone means Purple Goo shouldn't be used as the only means of alleviating maladies that require CBD preparations.

It's a great way to treat depression, anxiety, physical and mental fatigue, and everyday stress.

Frosted Flakes Strain,"Frosted Flakes is an indica dominant strain with a 70:30 indica/ sativa ratio. It is a cross between pre-98 and White Bubba. It has a 19% THC content that offers full body relaxation. The buds look as though they have been dipped in coke and smells like cereal, which explains how it got its name in the first place.

However, it is not known for an exceptional high, it will offer a good body buzz, but not enough to satisfy a cannabis user.

Firecracker Strain,"Firecracker is a genuine rarity, so scarce it's hard to get a lock on where it comes from or what strains were crossed to create it. It's an indica-dominant hybrid, and the sativa/indica ratio is roughly 30:70, though that's a rough estimate. THC data on this strain are difficult to find, so it's impossible to say how powerful it is. The same is true of CBD levels, though the fact that they're obscure suggests Firecracker isn't a great choice for patients with seizure disorders or other conditions that can be treated with CBD. The indica high is body-centric, with a peaceful, calming physical buzz, a boost of happiness, and mental relief. Those effects make this a good too for dealing with chronic physical pain and insomnia. It may also be helpful with depression and anxiety. There aren't many reports of adverse effects when using Firecracker, but red eyes and dry mouth are probably quite common. Paranoia may also be possible. This strain smells and tastes of red wine. The nugs are dense and sticky, with gold and light green coloring. Firecracker sells in very few places, so only dedicated strain hunters should add this to their bucket lists."

Kimbo Kush Strain,"Exotic Genetix out of Washington State crossed Platinum Blackberry Kush and Starfighter to create this unique, super-potent indica-dominant hybrid that placed at the 2014 Seattle Cannabis Cup. The exact sativa/indica ratio is unclear, but THC levels are reportedly massive, topping 27% in some tests. Other tests suggest levels as high as 29%, but most claims of THC contents above 28% are unreliable. Still, Kimbo Kush delivers a powerful body blow, with deep relaxation, sleepiness, and couch-lock effects that make it a good choice for late nights or rainy days. Medical applications include treatment for anxiety, muscle spasms, chronic pain, stress, and insomnia. But this strain isn't known for its CBD levels, which come in well below 1%, so it shouldn't be used as the only treatment for seizures or other disorders that respond to CBD. Kimbo Kush has a distinct berry flavor and smell with pungent notes of wood and earth, while the bud is green and purple with a dense, frosty layer of resinous trichomes. This strain can be found in Washington, Montana, Colorado, and Arizona, and while its popularity is growing, it isn't a widespread choice just yet."

It's an indica-dominant strain (15:85 sativa/indica ratio), and though its potency varies, it's nearly as strong as its parent: Some tests show THC levels over 25%, making Pure Kush one of the world's strongest strains.

Rather, its best medical use is as treatment for anxiety, depression, chronic physical pain, and insomnia. The body high is strong, fast, and profoundly relaxing, with a calming physical buzz and euphoric, creative cerebral effects. Adverse effects are limited, though dry mouth is relatively common; red eyes, paranoia, dizziness, and headaches are also possible but not typical.

Pestilence leans toward its OG heritage, delivering a heavy, relaxing body high that's ideal for the end of a long, busy day. The effects are physical, calming, and intensely hungry, making this a great choice for treating wasting or eating conditions. It's also effective as medicine for muscle spasms, nausea, pain, and insomnia. There aren't many public reports or tests exploring the THC levels in this strain, but it's said to produce a relatively potent high. But the scarcity of CBD data means Pestilence shouldn't be used to relieve seizures or other health conditions that require CBD treatments, unless a doctor or knowledgeable budtender recommends it. Notes of vanilla, caramel, and coffee dominate the sweet, smooth flavor and aroma of this strain. The bud has an olive green appearance with brown hairs and a layer of trichomes. Adverse effects probably include dry mouth and dry eyes, but credible reports on the subjects are scarce. Look for Pestilence in Canada and Europe, but don't look too hard, as it's rare even there."

These nugs are covered in a fine layer of resin and thick milky white crystal trichomes. Users describe the Blue Bayou high as an introspective, spacey dreamy creative high that is not ideal for social situations. You'll be trapped in your own mind, happy and uplifted, but not talkative in any sense. In fact, you'll be easily distracted and may be anxious around large numbers of people. Everything around you will be blurred, and you may experience an intense case of the giggles sporadically throughout the high. Due to these potent sativa effects, Blue Bayou is an ideal strain for treating patients suffering from conditions such as mild to severe depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic stress."

This bud has dense yet fluffy bright neon green buds with sparse dark olive green twisty leaves and thick rich amber hairs and amber undertones. These nugs are dusted with a fine layer of milky white almost amber trichomes and sweet sticky resin. Users describe the Green Apple OG high as having a heavy sativa high.

Burkle Strain,"Burkle is an indica-dominant hybrid that was created by crossing Granddaddy Purps with Pre-98 Bubba Kush, both strong indicas. It's roughly 75% indica (sativa/indica ratio of 25:75), and that means a high centered on the body. Available tests suggest THC contents of this strain can top 19%, making it one of the more potent medical choices available. CBD is negligible, however, only about 0.2%, so Burkle is not a good choice for alleviating seizures or other problems that respond to CBD. The body high is profoundly calming, a pleasant experience that leaves users relaxed and ready to sleep. Insomnia and pain are among the conditions this strain can treat, though patients with anxiety, depression, or mood disorders may also benefit. With a strong peppermint flavor, Burkle has an aroma of flowers and licorice. The loosely packed buds are flecked with bright green and strands of orange. This isn't a terribly popular strain, either for medical or recreational users, but it can probably be found on the legal markets in the American West. It's even less common on the black market."

Upon closer inspection, you will come to realize the buds are green in color and quite fluffy all the while being covered by trichomes. It has a fruity and tangy aroma and tastes just about the same. The name does speak for itself, as it does have an incredible lemony taste to go along with it. That being said, you have to keep in mind that the strain is quite potent. It is not recommended for the faint of heart, which is why beginners are advised to stay clear of Lemon Drop as well. It is the perfect strain for experienced cannabis users and is perfect for daytime use. That being said, it can also be smoked along with other medication. This is quite rare and not the case with other strains where side effects are to be expected. Individuals may feel euphoric and will experience an increase in appetite.

Sour Tsunami Strain,"The name of this increasingly popular medical choice refers not to the potency of its high but to the power of its symptom relief. Sour Tsunami has high CBD content, as high as 10% or even 11%, which makes it one of the most seizure-friendly medications on the market. THC levels, on the other hand, are quite low, usually less than 10%. That makes this a good choice for some children with severe epilepsy, as well as other patients whose conditions respond to CBD. A cross of Sour Diesel and NYC Diesel, this strain is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an unknown ratio of sativa to indica. Anyway, the genetic balance of Sour Tsunami is much less important to most patients than its high CBD content. This strain should be used to treat chronic pain, seizures, insomnia, and stress. It can also helps spur appetite in patients who need to eat more. Like its parents, Sour Tsunami has a sour flavor and smell with strong notes of diesel and earth. Though it's popular in California and Michigan, this strain is found mostly in the Pacific Northwest. It's hard to find on the black market."

So while it's not perfect for heavy users, Purple Widow can be a great choice for patients who haven't smoked marijuana before. CBD levels, however, are typically very low, less than 1%, meaning this isn't a good strain for patients looking to treat seizure disorders. But it is good at treating several other conditions, including anxiety, depression, lack of appetite, and migraine headaches. This strain is a descendant of Purple Power and the legendary White Widow. An indica-dominant hybrid, it has a sativa/indica ratio of 45:55 and delivers a calming, relaxing body buzz that, while not terribly strong, is enjoyable and effective.
