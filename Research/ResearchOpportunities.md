# Research Topics

This is a general overview of potential data generation that could be used to build better recommendations for application users.

> **Missing Data (Turpenes and Cannibanoids)**

Cannabanoid and Turpene concentrations are implicated to be responsible for the marjority of user-experienced effects.  using data from LABS, can we fill in missing component (turpene/cannabinoid) data based on REVIEWS?

> **Predict Postive & Negative Effects**

Using data from "The Association between Cannabis Product Characteristics and Symptom Relief" and other sources, predict negative impact based on concentration of components (turpenes/cannabinoids).

> **Dosing Advice**

Using pharmacokic studies and anecdotal evidence, build an evidence-based dosing scheduler for effects and time

> **Prescription Options**

Match off the shelf product to available prescription medications (route, intent, effect)

> **Medical Conditions**

Model medical condition descriptions -> prognsosis -> yes/no for cannabis option and if yes, component weights in prediction
